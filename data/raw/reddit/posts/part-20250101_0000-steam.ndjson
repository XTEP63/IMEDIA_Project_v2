{"id":"1p6i6da","name":"t3_1p6i6da","subreddit":"Steam","author":"Yarillo94","title":"Idea for steam machine price discount","selftext":"Since main worry of valve is that people outside of the gaming system can mass buy machines, since it is basically a PC, and never get into the steam ecosystem why not make a deal where you can buy a steam machine alongside as many games as you want and you get 10-15% cashback from the game price to the steam machine discount? Example: Buy 5 games for 50$, 10% cashback is 5$ per game, you get 25$ discount. It can be adjusted by what ever percentage Valve wants, they can give away those % that are for refunds or currency issues that Valve always sets aside for each purchased game.\n\nThat way new people who want to switch to steam and be actual gamers can get discounts on the machine because they have already invested in the ecosystem (what basically xbox and playstation already do by locking their ecosystem) without having to worry that someone will mass buy machines on discount and never invest back into it.\n\nYou can also make it so that already existing gamers who are well invested in the ecosystem can also get some discount on it based on their account purchase history. Focus especially those whos hardware is long outdated compared to the machine so that the machine is a proper upgrade to what ever they are having.\n\nThis would solve main worry that people outside of steam gaming might abuse the lower price and just buy machines for what ever they want without ever getting into steam.\n\nAnd for a safe measure for people abusing the return policy to just get a discount and then return the games make a policy so that games are non refundable (unless it is some extreme critical issue) and if you return the machine you lose those games.\n\nAny thoughts on this idea?\n\nTLDR:\n\n* You buy a Steam Machine + some Steam games together.\n* A percentage (10–15%) of the game purchases becomes **cashback** that reduces the price of the Steam Machine.\n* Existing long-time Steam users also get a discount based on their purchase history, focus on outdated hardware.\n* To prevent abuse, games bought in the bundle are **non-refundable**, and returning the machine removes those games.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1p6i6da/idea_for_steam_machine_price_discount/","permalink":"/r/Steam/comments/1p6i6da/idea_for_steam_machine_price_discount/","score":0,"num_comments":5,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764090777.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

But if we apply some simple maths to this, and look up some rough estimates of the number of owners there are on Steam, we can come up with a conservative estimate.\n\nAccording to VG Insights, Gamalytric and PlayTracker there are between 6.9, 8.65 and 9.46m owners for Battlefield 6 game on Steam.\n\nThe game is currently on sale for $59.49USD.\n\nThe price is higher or lower depending on region.\n\nFor arguments sake, lets say a good portion of sales happened outside of the US, so lets lower the average sale price to something like $50USD.\n\nAnd for number of owners, lets take the most conservative estimate of 6.9 million units.\n\nEven with these fairly conservative numbers, that puts the revenue for Battlefield 6 up to ... $345 million USD . Well beyond the $50m revenue threshold.\n\nWhat that means is that Valve received 30% on the first $10m ($3m), 25% on the next $40m of revenue ($10m) and 20% on the remaining $295m revenue ($59m).\n\nFrom $345m in revenue, Valve receives a total of $72m in revenue. \n\n72m / 345m = ... drumroll .... 20.8%.\n\nThis is WELL below the 30% number that often gets cited.\n\n**\"Not a good comparison, Battlefield sold like crazy! Not all games sell that well!\"**\n\nThat's my point!\n\nValve only makes 30% on the games which ***don't sell very well,*** and which Valve is doing most of the heavy lifting in terms of marketing and providing of infrastructure. For the big heavy hitters, like AAA games, or even the moderately successful AA games, basically anything that scores over about $30m in revenue, which is basically 90% of the games anyone will ever hear about, Valve's actual revenue cut is significantly lower than 30%.\n\nEven a game with only $34.5m of revenue, 1/10th of my very conservative estimate of Battlefield 6's of revenue, is still looking at only paying Valve a revenue cut of 26.4%.\n\nYou might not think this makes much of a difference. \"Pfft, 20.8 vs  26% vs 30%, whatever, it's close to 30%\", you might say.\n\nBut as everyone now knows very well (because there have been constant threads about it), Valve makes billions of dollars, that 4% does make a huge difference for Valve revenue wise.\n\nSo yes, while the revenue cut might start 30%, in reality what they receive is always actually much lower than 30%.\n\n..\n\nAnd also they don't get any revenue cut from steam keys sold outside of Steam. \n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1p65xzw/psa_for_anyone_who_doesnt_know_valves_revenue_cut/","permalink":"/r/Steam/comments/1p65xzw/psa_for_anyone_who_doesnt_know_valves_revenue_cut/","score":0,"num_comments":27,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764054352.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Fluff","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
