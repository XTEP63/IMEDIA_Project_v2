(Idols, anyone?)","selftext":"After finishing the latest 6.1 events, I realized that there was some dialogue hinting that there will be more international relationships with characters that share similarities in personalities/hobbies. In this event, it was with Nilou and Mualani, both being dancers and being the friendly girl people like. Both state that they want to meet each other much more often to collab and hang out.\n\nAnd in the Ruins Expedition event, after you finish the minigames, Paimon talks about show they should introduce their friends to each other and some examples include Itto and Ororon, Yoimiya and Navia, and Hu Tao and Jahoda.\n\nSumeru is my favorite region but I was disappointed with it's event, mainly because the relationships sticked to the status quo and nothing else was new. You have Cyno, Tighnari and Sethos as one group and Al and Kaveh as another. It's the same jokes and interactions and it's gotten stale. In the last Sumeru event, at least you got to see Kaveh and Faruzan interact for the second time (first time being all the way in 3.6 I believe). Even in Nod Krai, you have these little groups with Ineffa/Aino and Nefer/Lauma and the interactions have gotten a bit stale, at least for me.\n\nSo I'm kind of hoping that moving forward, events, anecdotes and other storylines have more varied character interactions and that those characters actually keep in touch over time (remember the last time Kazuha and Venti talked to each other?). Maybe future factions like the Hexerei (Mondstadt) don't have to be formed with characters from a single nation (like a Liyue Adeptus faction or an Inazuma Youkai faction) and it could be with characters from all around Teyvat. \n\nSome international faction ideas include Idols/performers (Nilou, Mualani, Barbara, Gaming), and maybe some kind adventurer faction, people that often leave home for one reason or another (Bennett, XL, Kazuha, Yoimiya, Dori)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p627uf","permalink":"/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/1p627uf/do_you_think_hoyo_will_create_more/","score":37,"num_comments":17,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764041940.0,"edited":false,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/WP1-59IYA9ohgrkJjpM4sqJ-ZWA4RQO-_lgeLRITCL8.jpg"}

{"id":"1p60jp0","name":"t3_1p60jp0","subreddit":"Genshin_Impact","author":"awesomejaspy","title":"More Liyue exploration! Genshin Impact Day 14","selftext":"Hello! I apologize for the shorter post today, I don’t have a lot of time! But I hope you guys had a nice start of the week.\n\nI saw there was a new event which gives double rewards, so of course I had to do some more Domains! Even though I really don’t like that Mondstadt Talent one… The double rewards made it better! I also did my Commissions. I don’t know how important they are to do but I’ve made sure to do all 4 everyday, I think it does give quite a lot of EXP.\n\nI went back to the place I started exploring yesterday, as I left off when I reached this village with crops (? Flowers?), it’s so pretty here! I got a lot of chests and Geo orbs. And I followed you guys’ advice and made my main character (Traveler? I think I’ll just call him that from now on since it’s easier) Geo. I don’t really like the skill that much when it comes to fighting because it feels a bit clunky to use and place and I really prefer the wind skills, but it is really useful to get to higher places!! I got some Geo orbs that I couldn’t reach yesterday, so thank you all for the tip. I did end up turning him back to Anemo after though haha\n\nSince I ascended Jean, I could also get her Talents higher and did just that. Luckily I already did some Domains for that in the past few days so I could almost get all of them to the maximum for now! I crafted some stuff to ascend Kaeya’s weapon too, but I’m kinda out of the weapon gems now… \n\nI went back to the Oceanid, this time with Lisa! She’s only at level 20 with a level 1 weapon, but I wanted to give her a try regardless. And actually… it did work pretty well! She didn’t do a lot of damage but the chain reaction that followed was pretty powerful. I did have to be careful because she almost died after two attacks, but Jean finished them off quickly! I think I’ll bring Lisa from now on if I have to fight the Oceanid again! I also went to the Electro cube since that’s a task in my Handbook, but didn’t need the rewards. It was pretty easy! And I fought the Cryo flower too, honestly because I quickly wanted to spend my Resin and this boss is the easiest for me. I have like 10 of those materials now haha\n\nLastly I started a new story quest, but starting it was also all I did. I hope to finish it tomorrow though! I did also get enough level up books to get Xingqiu to level 50. I do have enough Oceanid materials to ascend him but I need more of those flowers… at least now I know where they are and I have the Waypoint there, so it shouldn’t be too hard to get enough. I’ll do that tomorrow!\n\nI gotta go now, but feel free to friend me in the game or leave advice here. I’ve definitely been noticing that the enemies are getting stronger and harder to beat, so I think I could use the help.

I woke up early to play today!!!\n\nI started off by getting more flowers for Xingqiu. I was showering yesterday evening and that suddenly just popped into my head, “I need to get Xingqiu’s flowers!!!” So I made sure to remember. It wasn’t enough though, I still need 5 more for his next ascension… When do they come back? Is it everyday?\n\nAfter an intense murder spree of Treasure Hoarders I could ascend Kaeya, which I’m very happy with! I also could level up the Liyue Statue, since I got a lot more of those Geo orbs yesterday. What can I do with those stones? And I haven’t gotten any Shrine Keys, will I still get those? Because I know there are Liyue Shrines, I’ve already seen 2.\n\nAnd then… more Oceanid… and more Mondstadt Talent Domain… The less enjoyable parts of the game I must say lol\n\nI did more Repuation quests and Bounties (I think this is a weekly thing?) and came across the flying guy again… Honestly he definitely was stronger than last time, kinda scary!! He also has scary attacks where he hits really fast and goes spinning, I don’t wanna meet this guy again!!\n\nApparently I can still kick dragon butt so I fought Stormterror again. I’m also guessing this is a weekly thing, should I do this every week? It took me quite a bit! But then… I got my first golden artifact!!! I’ll be treasuring this!\n\nI went back to Liyue to explore the little part of the big area I hadn’t explored yet and helped a little girl find her book. Actually, no book was found. Nor the little girl. Useless! But I did get this domain, all the challenges were locked though. And I got to Rank 32! Woohoo!\n\nWhen I walked a bit further I came across a nice cave with a waterfall and Shrine, this’ll be my new hangout spot. I also got another fancy chest after having a really annoying fight with 3 big guys! They kept running off the mountain!!!!!! After that I decided I had to climb the big mountain next to it, that was quite the climb. But I got there and it was worth it!\n\nLastly I did some Leylines (I think the rewards are more worth it now), got struck by lightning (?!), leveled up Kaeya’s talents, and finally ascended the Traveler!\n\nThis was an eventful day, though I didn’t really do any quests like I wanted to. There’s always tomorrow though. I got a message in the game, that was very nice! You can also friend me in the game if you ever wanna help or play together, or leave a comment here with advice or whatever you want to say!
