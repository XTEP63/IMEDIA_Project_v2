{"id":"1p9joq9","name":"t3_1p9joq9","subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","author":"WorriedRadish111","title":"AITA for refusing to financially support my parents and explaining why when my brother asked?","selftext":"****Thanks, everyone, for paying attention to this post. I’ve read all the comments, and some of you even shared your own experiences. Honestly, reading through everything and answering some of the questions has felt like free therapy. I really appreciate everyone taking the time to respond.*****\n\n\nI (38F) have been living in a different state from my family for over 10 years. I’ve supported myself the entire time and rarely asked anyone for help. I didn’t grow up with my parents, my grandmother supported and raised me, and I never had a close relationship with them.\n\nLast year, I went on vacation with my siblings. During the trip, I found out that my youngest brother (29M), who makes the most money out of all of them, has been paying the mortgage and most of our parents’ living expenses. He asked me why I wasn’t helping financially.\n\nSince he asked directly, I answered honestly. I told him that our parents didn’t support me growing up, and that I still remember when my grandmother asked me to write them a letter requesting financial support for my education. My mom wrote back to my grandmother saying she should teach me not to ask them for money because what my dad earned was “just enough” for them and my three siblings. My grandmother let me read that letter, which I don’t think my mom knows.\n\nI told my brother that I contributed financially when we immigrated and that I paid rent when I lived with them for two years. I also used whatever money I earned to help support my grandmother, who actually raised me, until she passed away. After I moved to a different state, I’ve been completely on my own with zero financial help. Because of that history, I didn’t feel responsible for supporting our parents now.\n\nApparently, my brother told my mom. She confronted me via text and accused me of being “disrespectful” as a child. I explained my side and the experiences that shaped my feelings. She mentioned times she believes I was disrespectful, including verbal and physical conflicts. I explained that these incidents didn’t happen in isolation and were often triggered by her actions, such as trying to persuade my grandmother to send me somewhere to dance for money or deliberately ruining my school uniform by putting soy sauce on it. I told her she had not treated me like a mother should when I was growing up. The conversation didn’t go well, and afterward my mom stopped talking to me. Eventually, the rest of my family did too.\n\nNow I’m basically no contact with all of them. I feel like I told the truth and set a reasonable boundary, but somehow I’m the one who ended up alone. \n\nAITA for refusing to help financially and explaining my reasons when asked?\n\nINFO:\n\n1. So just to clarify: My siblings paying most of my parents’ mortgage isn’t actually a hardship, the cost is split three ways between two brothers and one sister, and they all still live in my parents’ home. I’ve never lived there and don’t even have a room in that house, so I’m being asked to contribute to a household I was never part of.\n\nTheir mortgage is under $2k, which is cheaper than what most people pay for rent right now. My siblings divide that amount based on income, my brother pays the most, and the other two split the rest. They also split utilities and groceries.\n\nMy parents also receive fixed income from Social Security, which they use to travel back and forth between two countries. They’re not struggling; they simply want to keep their same lifestyle without adjusting their spending.\n\nI’m married, and we don’t have kids yet. My husband and I set up our finances so either one of us could cover all household expenses alone if necessary. That’s intentional for if I get pregnant, I’d be able to stop working for a while without financial issues.\n\nMy parents and siblings see that stability and assume it means I have “extra” money to give them, basically because my husband could support me. \n\nRealistically, they could sell their house and make a significant amount of money, which would easily support their retirement back in my home country. My siblings are in their late 20s and early 30s, so they’re fully capable of moving out, renting their own places, and building their own independent lives if they wanted to.\n\nBut that’s not what they’re choosing to do. Living together is simply cheaper for everyone involved, and it benefits all of them. That’s their choice, but it doesn’t mean I’m required to subsidize it. So no, I don’t think I’m the asshole in this situation, which is why it’s confusing to be treated like I am.\n\n2. Soy sauce was the most accessible thing for her to use because it was one of our main seasonings at home. When I was a teenager, school meant everything to me, it was my escape, and the only path I saw toward a better future. Damaging my uniform wasn’t random; it was the easiest and most effective way for her to hurt me. It was a big deal too because I only had one uniform which means I hand wash it as soon as I get home then let it air dry overnight and wake up early in the morning to iron it. I basically had to hand wash it and dry it using an iron just to make it to school that day. \n\nThink of it like someone deliberately pouring red wine on a wedding dress, it’s meant to destroy the one thing they know matters most to you.\n\n3. Yes, during that time, “going abroad to dance” is often used as a cover to lure girls into trafficking. It’s presented as legitimate work, but many end up exploited once they get there. I hope that helps clarify it.

My company has an optional team social fund where each member of our small department contributes a set amount every month to cover birthday treats, team lunches, and small surprises. It sounded harmless, so I joined when my coworker Liam asked.\n\nHe manages the fund and everyone just sends him their contribution directly. Not that i suspected anything but last month, I asked if he could give me a breakdown of what the money had gone towards so far, because I’m trying to be better about tracking my spending. My mom drilled into me that I should always know where my money is going.\n\nHe said, Yeah, I’ll get it to you later. He didn’t.\n\nFew days later, he didn't send anything but he reminded me that my monthly contribution was due. I asked politely for the breakdown again. No reply. I waited a few days and sent a follow up, nothing. He responds to other messages in the work group chat, but mine about the fund get ignored.\n\nLast week he came to my desk and said, Hey, you still haven’t sent your part for the fund this month. I told him I’d be happy to once I got the breakdown I’d asked for, nothing complicated, just a list of what’s been purchased with everyone’s contributions.\n\nHis whole demeanor shifted. He sighed loudly and said, Nobody else needs this level of detail. It’s supposed to be casual. You’re making it weird.\n\nI told him it wasn’t personal, it’s just my budget and my comfort. He walked away mid sentence.\n\nNow a couple coworkers have hinted that I’m overthinking everything and making extra work for Liam. One even said I was being stingy for not just paying like everyone else.

My husband (29M) and I (26F) have another child who is almost 3. I didn't have a positive breastfeeding experience with her, I'm determined to have a better experience with our 2nd. His brother, my bil (30M) is a chronic yo-yo dieter. I personally think it's annoying because he tries to get everyone else around him to try it. I've always politely said no thanks. My husband has told him several times to stop bringing it up to me, but he's sneaky, and will ask when my husband is not in the room. I've just brushed it off as he's insecure.\n\nThere was one day when he and their sister (34F) were at our house and my husband had to use the bathroom. Bil asked me if I had done any research on how to loose weight when I have the baby. I had to take a deep breath so I didn't snap. I told him I had no plans for that. Then he proceeds to tell me about some kind of diet that requires cutting out all kinds of foods and apparently the baby weight will just fall right off. I told him no thank you, I'm not worried about my weight and neither are my doctors or my husband. Then he pressed even further, all while my husband is taking a shit. He asked me if I had any diets in mind and he would like to research them for me to see if they were good for me. I laughed and said that I would be on the see food diet. I'll see food and I'll eat it, because with breastfeeding, you burn lots of calories, so I'll probably be hungry all the time. He was visibly uncomfortable, but my sil was giggling. After my poor husband came out, bil suddenly decided he needed to take his dog for a walk. My husband asked if anything happened and I told him. He thought it was funny too and he was going to talk to his brother. I know I'm not the asshole, but part of me feels bad for the guy. If he's this insecure, could I be the asshole by being as sarcastic as I was?\n\nEdit and update for a few clarifications. First off, thank you to everyone for all the support. I didn't expect to receive so many comments, but you completely validated what I was already feeling. Something just felt off about the whole situation and boy was I right. To clarify since I saw a few comments about this, brother and sister in laws are my husband's siblings. Not a married couple. We don't live in Alabama.\n\nAs I'm typing this, I'm currently laying in a hospital bed in full on active labor. I had to be induced because my husband is 6'3, and I'm 4'9 and 41 weeks along. Get this thing out of me!\n\nAfter I posted this and it blew up, I showed some of the comments to him and I think a light bulb went off and we both realized we need to be better with setting boundaries. 2 days ago, he calls his brother to talk to him about how is constant talk about dieting is getting annoying and if he continues, we will have to limit contact. We are about to have 2 daughters and the last thing we want is for them to feel insecure about their bodies and their relationship with food. All his brother did was hang up. An hour later, their mom calls my husband screaming at him. Apparently, he is in the thick of an eating disorder and how dare he kick his brother when he's down and he needs all the support he can get. My husband and I were both taken aback. He told his mom that he didn't want to have to threaten with limited contact, but he also wanted to protect his girls and keep them from turning out like him. This made her even more angry and she proceeded to yell at him about not abandoning family. He let her go on for a few more minutes before telling her to get him some help before it's too late and hung up. We then both agreed that with my induction coming up so soon, this was all just bad timing, and we need to deal with this after we're home with our baby. We'll see if I have another update at a later time.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p6hdqx/aita_for_telling_my_bil_ill_be_on_a_see_food_diet/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p6hdqx/aita_for_telling_my_bil_ill_be_on_a_see_food_diet/","score":3909,"num_comments":156,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764089036.0,"edited":1764363317.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Hope I have it right here.  So this actually happened a few years ago but as I was decorating for Christmas I began to wonder if AITA. My grandmother's hobby was making ceramics. She always had a beautiful set that she made before my sister or other siblings were born. When I married, over 20 years prior to this interaction, I picked it up from her house and took it with me to my new home.\n\nOne Christmas, a few years back, my sister and her husband were over at my house visiting my kids. My sister said she wanted to talk to me.\n\nSister: Look I think we should take turns with the nativity. It was the family nativity that Grandmother made and its not fair that only you get to display it. I want to take it next year. (BIL was nodding in agreement)\n\nMe : Oh, Im so sorry. But this is not the family nativity , its mine.\n\nBIL: only becuase you took it before anyone else could say anything.\n\nMe: No, because it was mine. It was a Christmas gift for me.\n\nI picked up the manger part and showed them the bottom. It had the nickname my Grandma called me and the date it was made before my sister was born engraved in it.\n\nMe: This was made as a Christmas gift for me. It was given to me . We only kept it at Grandma's after you were born because as a toddler you grabbed one of the pieces and broke it. We just always kept it at Grandma's for safety as you and the other siblings came along. When I left for college I left it there and then took it when I got my own home.\n\nSister: (with great disappointment) I...I...never saw that under the manger. I never knew.\n\nMe: Im so sorry, Sis. This was a Christmas gift to me. It was always mine. Grandma made it for me. She wrapped up each piece for me to open on Christmas morning before you were born. I'm sorry you didn't know that.\n\nBIL: Well, I don't see why you cant just let us have it every other year. I think that's fair because everyone should give a chance with it\n\nMe: No. Its mine. It was a Christmas gift to ME. I'm sorry you thought it was for the family. But it was always mine. I'm so sorry you are disappointed but this stays with me.\n\nBIL was obviously angry but my sister was disappointed and she looked a bit sad.\n\nToday, as I was putting out the nativity, I started to feel a bit guilty. So was I the A?\n\nEdit to add since I see it coming up in the comments a lot.\n\nThey have a nativity that BIL inherited. Its and antique and valuable. \n\nAlso Grandma made things for each grandchild based on their interests at the time.

I May Have Ruined Thanksgiving with Jackbox","selftext":"For context, ever since I was 8 years old my older brother, ___________, would go out of his way to call me gay. These \"jokes\" were constant and I'd ask him to stop but his insults persisted until this very day, where I'm now 26 years old. I've asked him many times throughout my life to stop, and I'd only be met with an answer like \"Why bro? Is it cause you're secretly gay?\"\n\nMy brother, along with a few of my siblings, and myself all came to visit my parents today for Thanksgiving. I brought my amazing girlfriend over and this was her first time meeting my older brother. The first thing he does is pat me on the back and say \"I'm proud of you, bro. You've finally proved to me you're not gay.\"\n\nI booted up the ol' Nintendo Switch and our family played Jackbox, specifically Quiplash 2. Everyone was throwing in dicey jokes, but a lot of my brother's jokes were targeted at me being gay or overall contained gay themes. We played a round of Tee K.O. where he of course drew a guy sucking dick and wrote my name next to it. I asked him if he's just repressing his sexuality, and to no surprise he didn't even know what the word repress meant. So I incorporated his repressed sexuality into my Quiplash answers, and every single time all he'd say is \"It's okay bro, we all know you're really gay.\"\n\nLater that night we played one last game of Quiplash 2, and I got the question \"What would the worst drill sergeant constantly shout?\" My brother is a staff sergeant in the military, so I put a dumb answer saying \"Hi, my name is ___________.\" Once that answer came up, the family went silent, and he stated how he was getting ready for bed. My mom asked if that made him upset and he told me and my other brother that we can't take a joke and have to lash out at him.\n\nLong story short we had a classic \"family meeting\" where I threw in my two cents that I don't like being around my brother because all he does is belittle me. The conclusion my brother came to is that we just won't ever be at the same family gatherings again because we don't get along. Not to mention we are never in contact outside of these family gatherings. No phone calls, no visits, nothing; that goes both ways and probably for good reason. He then said that he was leaving tomorrow morning (and I honestly don't think we'll be seeing each other again.)\n\nI acknowledge I shouldn't have said that thing over Jackbox, but it was nice to lay everything out on the table and make my peace. He truly has a toxic nature that I don't care to associate myself with.\n\nAm I the asshole?

I've loved it since I was a teenager and I also understand it's not for everyone. Since I've known him I've probably watched the show twice over, by myself.\n\nYesterday we were at a family dinner, where a lot of his extended family were as well, and a cousin he's close to.

So my friends and I do a Friendsgiving every year. I hosted this year for the first time, and I planned everything from decorations, to food, seating, etc. One of my friends, “Kara,” (24f) has two dogs that she basically takes everywhere. They’re not emotional support animals or anything, she just likes having them around. Normally I’m okay with her bringing them here for a visit or two, but last year at our other friends house, one of her dogs snatched the dressing off the table and gobbled all of it while everyone was watching the game in the living room. I didn’t think this was very funny at the time and decided this year to make sure she can’t bring her animals to my house. \n\nYesterday in the group chat, I reminded everyone of the start time and I added, “Also, just a heads up, no pets this time, please.” I didn’t single her out specifically; I just made it a general statement.\n\nImmediately, Kara messaged me and asked if that meant her dogs. I said yes, that I really preferred she not bring them because I don’t want dog hair in the food, I don’t want to be managing animals in addition to hosting, and I don’t want a repeat of last year. There was also going to be several small kids attending, so I wanted to be extra careful. \n\nWell. She didn’t like that and immediately got super snarky and upset. She mentioned she had no one to watch her dogs, and I said they should be fine at home by themselves for a few hours yeah? She said no, because they had anxiety issues and need to be with her at all times. I said that’s unfortunate but I won’t be changing the rule I set. \n\nShe told me her dogs are “her family,” that they’re “better behaved than most adults and especially better behaved than kids,” and that I was being “controlling and purposely excluding her.” She said that if her dogs aren’t allowed, then she’s not coming. I told her I’d be sad if she didn’t come, but the rule stands because i’m hosting this year. She’s bringing the cake and the potato salad and I asked what her plans were for getting the food here. \n\nI even offered to pick it up. She then said she has zero intention of giving any food if her “family” isn’t welcome. While frustrating, I just told her that’s unfortunate and that I wish she’d just be a little more understanding, and then had to scramble to find dessert and potato salad at a grocery store halfway across town to fill in. \n\nNow a different friend said I could’ve “handled it more sensitively,” and that maybe I should’ve just let her bring them because “it’s the holidays and it’s not a big deal.” But honestly…it feels like a big deal to ME, because it’s my house and I’m the host.\n\n\nEdit: I think people are misunderstanding that I had zero idea that she brings her dogs everywhere and can’t leave them at home before this happened. The few visits to my house were only for brief visits where she came with other friends. I only included that info at the top of the post because I know *now* but at the time I did not. Most people I know are able to leave their pets at home and do not bring them places. So that was my initial assumption. I was shocked when she told me she brings them everywhere. \n\nAbout the emotional support animal bit, how do I know? Because another friend told me after this all went down, because I did initially feel bad and thought maybe she needed them around. But was informed that this wasn’t the case, and felt it was important info to add.

For context, we are both recent college graduates and she is working minimum wage jobs to save for grad school while I am in grad school but have tons of educational loans and no income. So, I cannot easily afford unexpected expenses. \n\nI have been to her house for thanksgiving many times in the past and I often help her family with the shopping or cooking since Thanksgiving prep can be hectic. Last year, my friend and I offered to make the charcuterie board and salad for her parents so they could focus on the Turkey, side dishes, and dessert. Her parents paid for all the groceries and my friend and I helped shop/cook/clean. They complimented the salad and charcuterie board and thanked us for making them. On multiple other occasions when I visited, I would help them with errands like getting groceries and even cooking meals, which they would pay for.  \n\nThis year, we did the same thing and told them we would help with the charcuterie board/salad, but after Thanksgiving, her mom got really angry and went and told my friend that she assumed I was going to pay for the charcuterie board/salad and she was surprised that I didn’t pay. My friend relayed the information to me. I was shocked and caught off guard but asked my friend what to do and whether we should pay but she said it was fine, but in the future we should only shop for the dishes her parents were cooking and nothing else. I was okay with that, but then while my friend was sleeping, her mom cornered me in the house and started to chastise me about not paying for the groceries and kept saying that I was not a kid anymore and should now contribute to the Thanksgiving potluck. I was unaware that Thanksgiving was supposed to be a potluck, nobody told me that before. I just noticed that when my friend’s aunt/uncle/cousin visited they would bring one dish. I thought that was like a hostess gift, which I already had brought (a $40 box of fancy chocolate). I thought I was a guest and was helping them shop/cook something that their daughter had okayed buying on their card and they had okayed last year. \n\nIt was so awkward and I tried to pay her mom back, but she wouldn’t accept the money, but she also wouldn’t stop chastising me. Her behavior felt really rude and inhospitable. I feel very hurt that she called me out like that while my friend was sleeping and then later again while my friend was present. Nobody in her family said that they expected us to pay for the appetizer/salad this year.. if they had done that, I would not have brought them such an expensive gift of chocolates. I feel so uncomfortable going back to their house especially for thanksgiving, because in my culture what her mom did is the rudest thing ever. If she had a problem, she should have talked to her own daughter who ultimately was the person swiping her card for the groceries we bought. AITA or my friend’s mom? \n\nEdit: My friend and I spoke and she apologized for her mom’s behavior and I apologized for not offering to contribute. My friend also apologized for assuming her mom was paying and okay with that which led to all of this. Now my bff and I are fine. Her mom apparently takes a week to calm down and always has outbursts like this, but the first I’ve had the unfortunate pleasure of witnessing. My friend says she has problems with her mom’s anger and cannot wait to move out and the chances of her mom apologizing are zero because that’s just how she is even to her own family. My friend also said her family doesn’t hate me and wants me to visit again. My friend thinks it might also help if I contribute financially for a regular meal. I don’t want to visit for thanksgiving anymore but am okay going at a non holiday time and only if other friends are also visiting. I forgive her mom because I want to maintain the relationship and I will still invite her family to my wedding next year and my bff is still invited to my parents house this winter. But I will never give her mom fancy hostess gifts again and my bff agreed with my decision. No more fancy chocolate, only something small/inexpensive.

It was supposed to just be us and our two young children at home. Nothing big, nothing dramatic.\n\nMy husband is the middle child of three children.  A couple weeks ago, his sister( “SIL”) 29, mentioned she didn’t have anywhere to go for Thanksgiving, so I invited her. No intention behind it, just trying to make sure she wasn’t alone.\n\nThen earlier today, we invited my father-in-law (“Dad”) because we found out his wife would be out of town. Again, it wasn’t planned. It was just one of those “hey, you’re welcome to join us if you want” things.\n\nHere’s where it gets messy.\n\nMy brother-in-law (“BIL”) 34, recently got back together with his ex (“GF”) 33, after almost three years apart. Their breakup back then was extremely messy…DVRO court orders on BOTH sides, custody issues, all kinds of fallout. It affected everyone in the family in a very traumatic way.\n\nGF and SIL do not get along…at all. They have a long history of issues and are just generally nasty to each other. When BIL got back together with GF, SIL actually asked for space from him because she couldn’t handle being around that situation again. And I don’t blame her. \n\nSince BIL and GF are well aware of the tricky dynamic, my husband and I just assumed that they would spend Thanksgiving together. It honestly didn’t even cross my mind to invite BIL, especially because inviting him without inviting her would have caused a whole different kind of problem. Sister and GF cannot be in the same room. There’s no scenario where that goes smoothly.\n\nAnyway, GF found out SIL and Dad were coming over, and she went nuclear on me for not inviting BIL. She told me it was rude, exclusionary, and like we were sending some kind of message or choosing sides. She said she wasn’t being passive-aggressive (she was), and she even said that she could be off the mark, but in the conversation that followed, it was apparent she’d already decided what our intentions were.\n\nI explained that SIL was invited weeks ago, Dad was invited literally just today, and we genuinely just assumed (logically) that BIL had his own plans with her and the kids.  \n\nShe didn’t accept that and stuck to her version of events.\n\n Nothing was meant to exclude him, and honestly, I felt like inviting him without her would’ve been just as disrespectful in a different way. Not to mention, SIL asked for space.  So it would have been disrespectful to her as well.  So now I’m sitting here feeling upset and discouraged.

His response was literally:\n\n“Oh, I don’t care.”\n\nThat was it.\n\nHe just assumed we were having our own Thanksgiving, and he had his plans. End of story for him.\n\nSo the whole thing that blew up wasn’t actually coming from him at all. He wasn’t upset. He wasn’t excluded. He wasn’t sitting somewhere feeling unloved. He was totally fine.  \n\nI feel vindicated 🤣\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p7itlm/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_in_law_to_our/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p7itlm/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_in_law_to_our/","score":1907,"num_comments":211,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764189549.0,"edited":1764344321.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

However this event does float around my head from time to time and I keep wandering if I was the asshole or if I was justified in my response.\n\nA while ago back when I was around about 19 years old. (I am 30 now) my mom had her friend around to visit for a few days. My mom and her friend \"Rachel\" are very close to each other however me and Rachel do not have any form of close relationship.\n\nI can tolerate her and be friendly but I always have a feeling that our personalities clash and sometimes we get ourselves into uncomfortable situations.\n\nMy Mom and Rachel were both discussing the wedding of Rachels daughter, 'Ellen' (Who was in her late 30s at this point) From the few times I have seen her she seemed like a lovely lady but again, me and Ellen were not that close either. Not that we did not like each other but the amount of times that I have met her I can count on one hand, So we pretty much knew each other existed but that was about it.\n\nAs they were discussing the wedding Rachel turned to me and asked me if I was going to be able to make it to the wedding with my Mom. At this time I did not even know that Ellen even was getting married.\n\nI looked at her and asked her who was going to be there other than me and my Mom. She started to list off a bunch of names that I had no idea who they were or names that I barely recognised.\n\nAfter she stopped she was looking at me expectantly and I had apologised to her and basically said to her that unfortunately I would be extremely uncomfortable going somewhere that I didn't know, and be with a huge gathering of people that I had no knowledge of for many hours in a row.\n\nMy Mom was very understanding as she knew how difficult it is for me to function in large crows, especially if that large crowd was full of people I did not know and she said that was fine.\n\nRachel however had the opposite reaction. Tried to make excuses for why I can go, That my mother was going to be there and that she would be disappointing Ellen a lot if I did not go. I said to her that I did not really know Ellen all that well and we had only met a handful of times so I doubted that she would be that disappointed by my absence considering that we were not even friends.\n\nI don't remember the words that were exchanged but me and Rachel had an argument in front of my Mom who very much stayed out of the argument and watched it continue, which I understand because what do you say when your son and best friend are fighting in front of you.\n\nWhen she left my mom came to my room and asked if I was sure I did not want to go and I said to her \"Most definitely not now after that\"\n\nAfter the wedding, she looked through photos with my mom in the living room and made off hand remarks about how I would be in them if I had attended, Which I gave no attention and just returned to my room until she left. \n\nSo AITA?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pb2goi/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_moms_friends/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pb2goi/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_my_moms_friends/","score":1719,"num_comments":60,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764560718.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I was excited to introduce him to everyone but no one seemed interested in talking to him and totally left him out all the festivities. It left me and him feeling a little disrespected. I mean nothing beyond giving him a handshake and asking for his name, and obviously ignoring him when he tried to talk, and even trying to sit him with the kids! \n\nOn top of inappropriate comments about me and my sisters weight from family my grandmas new husband asked us to come out and help string up christmas lights, they asked some of the boys to come out and help and I joined them because I didn’t want to leave my boyfriend alone. \n\nAfter we were finished I asked if they were going to put up the lawn decor as well, to which he responded with saying I should put it up myself because I was lazy and wasn’t much help. I am a very sensitive girl and started crying. Everyone ignored it for a little until he (grandmas new husband) made a comment about how sensitive I was. \n\nMy boyfriend and I slipped out secretly and left after that feeling disrespected and pretty upset about the whole ordeal. No one even noticed until over halfway home. I received texts from my mother and grandma furious that I had just left, and they were both frustrated over how I handled it and believed it was rude of me and bf to leave. On top of that, they said it was immature of me to cry over a comment like that and I should just get over it because of all my family, specifically my grandma has done for me. \n\nI think neither one of us were shown any morsel of respect, and people were just outright rude to me and him. \n\nAITA? \n\nedit: If anyone is curious i went to my moms house today and we had a serious conversation about some things and ultimately came to the conclusion that our side of the family, (my immediate family, brothers, sisters, dad, and mom) would not be going to christmas this year, and instead it would be hosted at my moms house with just us. I’d say the conversation with her went pretty well, my mother has always been a very sweet and supportive woman. \n\nAlso thank you for all the kind comment!

She told me she wants to move out because she wants a parking spot. We went over what she wants in a new place: cat-friendly, spacious 2-bedroom, downtown, near a metro, with parking, and all for less than ~$900 each. I told her that wasn’t realistic. I’ve been searching for months and haven’t found anything close.\n\nShe wants to move out in the summer, but in our city everyone moves in the summer.

She knew I loved cats, I'd always wanted one so that was her gift and it was the best gift I've ever received. I was the one who organized his diet, litter trained him, named him Casper, got him to respond to his name, had him snuggle with me, had huge arguments with my parents in the initial days over him and defended him. Over time Casper became an integral part of our family.\n\nLast week we were just planning on how to start moving my stuff to my fiance's place and I also brought up his cat tree. My younger sister was like why would you take his cat tree you're not taking Casper. I said ofcourse I am, he's my cat, and my fiance loves cats too, I'd already discussed this with him. My parents too were against taking him, and my sister started full on sobbing. I was beside myself, and we had an argument, I told them Casper was a gift for me, I had raised him when he was a kitten, and I brought up to my parents how they used to say he's too much work and a mess in the earlier days. Since then whenever the topic has been brought up my sister gets heated, my parents low key side wirh her saying Casper is used to the house and cats are creatures of habit, I've told them they have 3 months to make their peace with the fact that Casper is coming with me. AITA?\n\n\n\nEdit: To address some frequent questions.\n\nMy college was in the same city we live in, as is my job. I commuted to college from home. And no, my fiance and I haven't been living together.\n\nThe first time my dad and I took him to the vet he was registered under my name.\n\nUntil I got a job after college, I would do his expenditures with my pocket money and my parents would also pay. Since I've been working, I do the bulk of spending on him, but my parents do too.\n\nMy sister is 17. And yes we'll be living in the same city she'll be seeing him often.

This ceremony was organized by students, not the university, though it will be held on campus\n\nIt's important to note that this student-organized ceremony is the only event for receiving our diplomas. There is no separate, official university ceremony. The only other related activity is going to the administration office on a designated day with your family to pick up the physical degree and paperwork, but that is not a ceremonial event.\n\nNOTE: This diploma ≠ the official degree for my major. As I said before this diploma is only a statement that our generation's period ended.\n\nThe reason I don't want to go is that my graduating class has a horrible reputation. Many of them have engaged in awful attitudes and have even committed acts that are supposed to be punishable, far more so than other classes. While not every single person is terrible, the other students are largely skipping this event, meaning it will be dominated by the troublesome people I actively \"despise\". I straight don't like them nor want to be around them.\n\nI told my mom I wasn't going, and she called me egotistical, self-centered, and a coward for not being able to tolerate a few hours with people I dislike. She said I was only thinking about myself and not about my family. She insisted this event was important for them and that I was denying them the experience. She heavily guilt-tripped me by adding that as her only child, she has no other graduations to attend.\n\nI argued that it was unfair to guilt me for my decision. She replied that I was being inconsiderate and that she would \"keep in mind that I only care about my own feelings.\"\n\nTo defend myself, I reminded her that I'm not a selfish person. When I was a teen, I went along with a Quinceañera party that I didn't want and didn't enjoy, purely to make my family happy. She just laughed and dismissed it, saying, \"Oh well, it's in the past now, it doesn't matter anymore.\"\n\nThe argument ended with her asserting her authority, saying, \"You don't know me, child. My ego is stronger than yours, and I decide we're not going now because I say so.\" But despite her final word, her accusations have stuck with me and made me question if my stance is wrong.\n\nMy mother believes I'm an asshole because she sees my refusal as a selfish and cowardly act that ruins an important \"family milestone\" for her, especially since she has no other children (even though she's attended my older cousin's diploma ceremonies). I feel I'm making a decision based on my valid discomfort, but her words are making me second-guess myself.\n\n  \nUpdate: Now she doesn't speak to me or acknowledge me. Well, still, thank you everyone, I'm really grateful for your insights.

When we moved in together, I brought my queen bed and we put it in a spare room for guests. Since then, we've had a couple friends and my sister visit and each time they've stayed in the guest room. \n\nFiancé's parents are staying one night for the holiday, and he had planned to have us move over and sleep in the guest room and give his parents our room. \n\nHis logic is simple: his parents are older (late 50s), would have easy access to the en suite and it's what he's always done for their visits. \n\nThe one difference is that whenever they've visited in the past, it was at his old place with no guest room/bed, so he offered them his room, he slept on the couch, and I would be at my place. \n\nWe recently got a king sized bed, and so the bed he used to have (that his parents have slept on) is in the guest room, and my old bed is now not in use but still in the house for additional guests. \nWhen we bought the mattress, he texted his family about I, and then also said \"so you guys will have a comfy bed to sleep on for Thanksgiving\". It didn't occur to me that meant us giving up our bed and sleeping in the guest room, but I learned this morning that's what he intends. \n\nI feel weird about it. \nThe guest room has the bed they've always slept on for visits\nThere's a guest bathroom directly next to the guest room (not en suite)\nAnd we'd have to wash the sheets twice in 24 hours and adjust a bunch of our stuff to move over there. \nOn a personal note, before it was his room he was giving up, but now it's our room, and I don't love people being in my stuff regardless of snooping (they're very nice. I'm not worried about them intruding, specifically, but the principle of the matter)\n\nThe thing is, he already promised it to them and we'd be going back on that. \nI don't know if I'm willing to fight over this, but I am trying to understand his perspective and help him understand mine. We have different cultural backgrounds, so perhaps that's a barrier for us. \n\nThoughts? \n\nEDIT: A couple details I realized I forgot that add some nuance:\n\n-His parents have separate bedrooms at home and they typically don't sleep in the same bed, but the largest bed they have in a queen. Fiancé thinks giving them the king is easier for them to share a bed with each other, since it's not their norm.  \n\n-His mom has had health issues (brain surgery in the last year) and so we all want to make her as comfortable as possible. I just think the guest room is adequate. \n\n-They WILL be sleeping in our bedroom when they visit for our wedding next year. That is established and agreed upon. We'll be in a hotel and his parents and sister will be in our house. So regardless, they will sleep in the bed at some point. Just in that case, we won't also be in the house.\n\n\nUPDATE:\nThank you to everyone who helped me see more of his side and further understand why this was all getting to me. \nGrossness factor of sharing beds aside, I think at its core it was just hard for me to process a decision being made and communicated without my input. And I was stressed over being the \"bad guy\" and contradicting him, and didn't appreciate being put in that position. \n\nFiancé and I spoke about how I didn't appreciate being cut out of the decision making process, and he apologized and admitted he didn't really think about it much past what he's always done. \n\nWe agree the guest room is sufficient, it's just that he had deep cleaned our room in prep and was having the recalibrate and consider doing a full clean on the guest bedroom too that made him put up resistance earlier. \n\nWe're good. We've also talked through some other situations where we've made decisions for the other person without their full input and consent (I've done this when making plans with my parents too), and I think we have a decent plan moving forwards.

My best friend (28F) is in a long-distance relationship with her fiancé (31M), who lives near Albany, NY. When they first started dating six years ago, he lived in a apartment with a roommate, worked 12-hour warehouse shifts, and didn’t have a car. After two years the job became too strenuous, he quit, and moved in with his aunt rent-free. For the next four years he didn’t work and spent most of his time with his friends, smoking weed and gaming 3–4 times a week. His excuse for not finding another job was that his aunt’s car broke down (which he used to get to his warehouse job ) and the city was an hour away.\n\nTwo years ago my best friend got a job opportunity in Connecticut, got to move closer to him and asked him to move in with her, but he refused without giving any real explanation. She assumed it was because of the car situation even though she was even willing to share hers temporarily.\n\nDuring that year things became financially stressful for her, so she asked if she could move in with my fiancé and I with her three cats . We agreed since we had a spare bedroom and gave her three months to get back on her feet but said after that she will need to pay $700 for rent.  She agreed but within four months of living with us she quit her job, and for the next four months she bounced from job to job. Because of that, my fiancé and I barely received rent. We’d occasionally get $100–$200. She came to us that she was struggling still so we agreed to lower her rent to $400. Now in two months of that her having a job she really enjoys and wants to pursue as our career we been having to remind her to pay rent.\n\nFast forward to 4 months ago: he won a couple thousand dollars on a scratch ticket, bought a car outright, and finally has a job in by where he lives in New York. Now My best friend feels they’ve been together long enough and asked him about getting married. He agreed, so now they’re planning a courthouse wedding in two months. ( don’t ask why she’s rushing to get married. I have no clue but I know for sure it’s not because she’s pregnant.)\n\nLast week she asked me if he could move in with us, and I told her no. We already have five cats in the house between the three of us, and he has two more meaning seven cats total. On top of that, my fiancé, my best friend, and I are all comfortable not wearing pants at home, and that would have to change for him. My fiancé also has trauma and doesn’t feel comfortable living with a man she doesn’t know well not because he’d do anything, but because of her PTSD. And he would still need to find a job down here, which means both of them would rely on us financially until he’s stable. It doesn’t make sense, especially since he’s currently living rent-free where he is. So am I the asshole?

Funny enough, we needed to complete some core curriculum classes and we ended up in the same Algebra class (same teacher, same time). \n\nI’ve always been good at math, so this class was easy and I was getting over 100% with extra credit. My sister is gifted in other ways, but struggles with math and was on the verge of failing the class. My parents wanted me to help tutor her which I was happy to do. That went just as well as you can expect tutoring your sibling would go. \n\nSo here’s the problem. I got a homework assignment grade back as a 5/20. Which I thought was extremely odd as I had gotten 100% on the exam in that unit. My friends told me everyone makes mistakes and it wouldn’t really affect my grades anyways. \n\nThe next day in class, my professor pulls me aside (my sister had skipped class that day) to tell me that my homework had the exact same answers and work as my sisters. I told her I had nothing to do with that and I was surprised to hear it. She told me she believed me and we can settle on that grade instead of taking it to a bigger level. So basically there was nothing I could do to change that grade and I was lucky there weren’t worse consequences. The professor ended up giving her a 0 on that assignment. \n\nI confronted my sister and she admitted to stealing my homework out of my backpack and copying the answers. I was pissed. I talked to my parents about it and they told me to let it go because “she’s drowning and pulling you down with her” and that I’m not going to fail the class because of this. They also told me that I shouldn’t have thrown my sister under the bus for this. I feel bad for her and I understand why she would do this, but I tried tutoring her and this is huge for me.

It was a pretty spur-of-the-moment occurrence and I had to drop things rather quickly. I informed one of my friends and they offered to put me up for a few days. I said that would be great, but told them I'd have my dogs with me so totally understood if they wouldn't be able to. The friend said it would be fine and they were more than happy to host me. \n\nFor context, my dogs are not badly trained by any standard, but they are both large breed dogs (a lab and a GSD) so of course can be a bit \"much\" for many non-dog owners. I am aware of this and that's why I usually don't bring them to peoples houses. \n\nI made the 5 hour drive down and my friend came out to greet me. When unpacking the car I let the dogs out and immediately they went off to toilet (since it was a long trip). My lab went into the bushes to pee but the GSD began to pee in the middle of the front porch (don't ask me why, but she much prefers peeing on hard surfaces) and my friend immediately freaked out. I was a bit confused and apologised but it's outside so didn't get why she was so freaked out. \n\nThe dogs were fine the entire stay. They are non-eventful inside. They let me know when they need out and I clean up the poo straight away. I keep them under good supervision. \n\nAt the end of the trip, my friend sent me a text saying \"Hey, as you'd know the house is quite messy because of the dogs, and I'm going to hire a cleaner. Would you mind paying me for that?\" I was a bit taken aback. The dogs had zero accidents inside. Didn't break anything. I asked what she meant, and she explained that there was dog hair everywhere. \n\nThe thing is, they are shedding dogs. I know that. If she'd asked me to vacuum up after them I would have. But she didn't. I also don't think a deep clean would be necessary. A quick vacuum of the carpets, couch, bed, etc. would be more than enough to remove any trace. I don't know what to do. I didn't ask to stay with her - she offered. I told her about my dogs, and she was fine with that.

{"id":"1p7nx5s","name":"t3_1p7nx5s","subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","author":"PutPrior542","title":"AITA for screaming at my family that they “effing” ruined my birthday?","selftext":"I feel like I’m losing my mind right now so I apologize in advance if it’s unclear. For the sake of this post, and for privacy reasons, My mom is Linda, 52F, my first sister is Jade, 27F, my second sister is Bella, 25F, my brother is Luka, 20M, my dad is John, 55M, my friend is Eric, 17M, and my brother in law is Kyle, 27M. I am 16F.\n\nSo, my birthday was yesterday. The day had gone by well until it was time to go to dinner. You see, in my family, the celebrant always gets taken out to eat with other people they pick. It’s simple, the celebrant chooses who they want to join them, and then they go out to a place of their choice.\n\nNaturally, as it was my birthday, I figured I would be given that privilege too. The plan was for it to be just Jade, Kyle, Eric, and Myself. Just four people were supposed to go, including me. Unfortunately, that plan fell through as Kyle was running late, so Linda decided to tag along. \n\nI had already been a little irked because Linda had been telling me that I’m wasting Eric’s time, but I let it go. I had already told Eric the situation and he understood and told me not to worry about it. We were about to head out the door when Linda stopped me, and asked me: “Aren’t you going to invite the others?” Not wanting to get into the reasons why I didn’t want Bella there, I caved.\n\nThe whole family minus John ended up going. I was irritated but didn’t make a big deal since it was my birthday. Somehow, Jade and Bella started talking crap about the other, which ended up in Bella crying and running to her room saying in a babyish tone that no one loves her and that we all hate her, which made Luke and Linda go comfort her. A while later, we finally got to the restaurant and sat down and Bella started crying and saying the same stuff. AGAIN. Adding in that she’d be better off dead. Everyone started babying her (she has a fetish), so I started crying, in front of everyone. \n\nI managed to calm down before we left the restaurant because I had to go get my cake. (they didn’t plan on buying me one) I get my cake and headed home, and yet again Bella started crying. I had enough at this point and told her to pull it together that she’s not ruining another birthday by making it about her, and she left. I had subpar cake, a present that had no thought put into it, then when I finally got out of my bathroom from crying, I told my sisters and mom that I was extremely disappointed in them and sad that they couldn’t have given me just one day about myself, and that they could behave on other people’s birthdays but mines. I was crying by this point and everyone tried telling me it wasn’t their fault and so I screamed:  “YOU ALL FUCKING RUINED MY BIRTHDAY, DO YOU WANT A COOKIE OR SOMETHING?!?”\n\nThey all got offended and now Bella is telling everyone that I hate her, and want her dead, Jade is acting like she did nothing wrong and blaming me for being ungrateful for the gift she gave me, and Linda is also blaming me for everything.\n\nAITA?\n\nQuick mini update: I almost got hit by a car (why do they give licenses to idiots??) and later i should be able to give some much needed context and info that I forgot in my original post (damn the 3000 character limit) . I know I seem like an ass to my family but I’ll explain why this situation is what it is.\n\nEDIT: A lot of people feel like I’m excluding certain members for no reason so let me clarify:\n\nI didn’t want Bella there because she often complains about where I pick, saying that I could’ve picked a better place because there’s not a lot of options for her. (All in a pouty baby voice, and no she doesn’t have any allergies and she’s perfectly healthy, she’s just very picky like my brother Kyle). Also, another thing is that she’s ruined stuff meant to be about me before. Like my quinceañera. But that’s a story for another time. The main issue I have is her hellbent on making me have her boyfriend an active part of my life (I’m extremely uncomfortable to the point where I can’t be around grown men or men in general due to some childhood trauma) even when I tell her I just need time. She just keeps pushing and doesn’t respect that. Not to mention, her last boyfriend (her latest ex) tried freaking GROOMING ME (not the first time that’s happened) and she did NOTHING about it. I supported and loved her even when she told me that no one else did. One day we were arguing about how her boyfriend is and she said “well at least he loves and cares about me” which broke me because up to that point, I had defended her against the rest of my family about the way she is, and she just forgot so easily about that and picked a dude that tried grooming me over me. (Her ex ended up grooming a 16 year old, and has groomed others, last I heard.)\n\nBella is also into age play. She acts like a baby and even more so when she doesn't have attention and will start throwing tantrums. She also does this to everyone, no matter if they want to take part in it or not (it makes people uncomfortable around her) and she likes dressing like one. Pacifier and all. (Hence the kink mention.) But I apologize if I’m confusing it for something else.\n\nI didn’t want my mom there as like Bella, she finds anything and everything to complain about every single time we go out, including the way people look, (mainly me) the food, the decor, etc.. whatever she orders she ends up hating and talking about how “Mexican food is better” (she’s extremely racist, and will purposely call people slurs, like Jade and Kyle and Luke)\n\nMy dad didn’t go because he works really late, and he’s never there for anything. Not my achievements, competitions, NADA. He’s also made it abundantly clear he doesn’t like me. He’s told everyone including me how disappointed he was that I wasn’t a boy (everyone was) and when I was born he literally walked out on my mom in the delivery room all because he found out that I was a girl. My dad is sexist and misogynistic and he has no table manners. He will burp in your face and fart with no shame, he’s done this while I’m eating dinner and then will lift up his leg and fart on my head) then call you a pussy for not liking it. He also thinks the only thing a woman is good for is cooking and cleaning and shutting up (he absolutely hates when anyone tries questioning his opinions, which is why he hates me). He also threatens to hit and has hit me over the smallest things, like me being tired. One time when I was 12, I came home tired after school (I do extracurricular activities) and plopped down onto my bed. My dad came in because he was hungry and said “if you don’t get your lazy ass off I’m going to smack the shit out of you and give you a reason to obey me.” After I did what he asked, he complained and told me that the food I make is shit and that I should’ve tried better. (I’m a child?!?) \n\nAlso to everyone saying that we’re dysfunctional (thank being born into a heavily dysfunctional Hispanic household), we really are and taking away from the fact that I wouldn’t be born, I don’t think my mom should’ve married my dad. (how they met is a whole other story) They’re set to divorce when I graduate high school anyways. Yay. \n\nJade came along because she’s the sister I mostly get along with and also because I had no choice. While she doesn’t whine about what place I pick all the time, (she does, but it’s less frequent) she does often body shame me, telling me I need to gain weight or my clothes will just slip right off me. (she’ll talk badly about my appearance, my hair, my weight, my face, etc..) if I tell her that it’s shitty of her to do that to me, or if I start crying, she’ll start crying and then mom will get mad at me and tell me I’m an ungrateful brat for hurting Jade when she does so much for me. Jade also for some reason thinks I want to steal Kyle away from her. (No girly, he’s all yours 🤢) There was one time that I got done exercising, and she started accusing me of trying to show skin for her boyfriend, (I was 15.) saying that I needed to cover up because what I was wearing was inappropriate and that I’m trying to steal away her boyfriend by dressing like a slut. (How is a NORMAL tank top and sweatpants in any way sexy?!? Not to mention, I’m a minor???)\n\nLuke is insufferable to be around as he only ever talks about how the world wrongs him and how he hates everybody and that me and the rest of the women in our family are idiots and fat whales and he acts like everyone is better than him.\n\nKyle didn’t come by my choice. He got invited to come by Jade. Also, they’re not married (yet) but if I refer to him as anything less than my BIL, my family, (especially Jade and my mom) will get on my ass about it.\n\nEric is the one who invited me out for dinner, (since he knows a restaurant I like going to) and my mom told me i couldn’t go because she thinks I’m going to screw him or something. (Ew) So she told Jade to go with me to keep an eye on me. \n\nI probably still have more to add but that’s what I got for right now.\nI currently have to deal with a whiny Luke who hates kids and is badmouthing them, a mom who keeps on getting on my ass for me telling her how I felt, and finally, a Jade and Kyle who are both equally talking shit about me behind my back.\n\nUpdate: I once again tried talking to my mom about how I felt, calmly, tonight, and she proceeded to tell me in Spanish that I’m ungrateful and that family is family no matter what they do to me. I don’t even know what to do anymore because either way is a lose-lose situation. Sometimes I wish I wasn’t born into this whole mess of a family, but I was and it’s my personal hell.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p7nx5s/aita_for_screaming_at_my_family_that_they_effing/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p7nx5s/aita_for_screaming_at_my_family_that_they_effing/","score":831,"num_comments":133,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764202402.0,"edited":1764478353.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I just ran out of food in the fridge. Eggs, bread, milk, cheese, fruits, other things. I tell my mom who took the ebt card with her so I couldn’t use it because she is for some reason very protective of it, that we ran out of food. She tells me to buy it with my own cash. Now I can buy a haul of groceries but my bank account would take a hit. I have a job but work little hours and make 500-700 a month. My mom also lied and said the ebt card has no money but she doesn’t know I have access to seeing the balance which is 500 dollars right now. My argument is that it would be unwise to spend the little money I have on groceries my mom is supposed to be legally responsible for until I am 18, but she is in another country and has been for weeks not doing her job as a mother. Opposed to just letting me use the ebt card. I just don’t see why I can’t use money dedicated to groceries and that can ONLY be used on groceries especially in an emergency where I have no guardian at home and no food.

We’re not having sex, but just sit and relax. I personally wouldn’t have gotten it on my own for that reason, but I’m not going to stop him from doing what he wants to do for me. It took over an hour of driving through a mild snow storm to get here and I honestly just wanted to decompress. \n\nSo we get to the room, and it’s decorated. And as I’m turning around to thank him for putting the effort in, he’s recording me. I’m EXTREMELY self conscious about my appearance. I had no make up on, no cute clothes, and I’m exhausted from driving. I’m literally not in the mood to be recorded. So instead of telling him thank you like I was going to, I asked why are you recording me. \n\nThat ruined everything for him and now he has an attitude because I didn’t react how he wanted me to. I feel like he doesn’t understand it from my perspective. I’m in my most vulnerable state only to have a camera shoved in my face. Now I feel bad because I made him upset. AITA for not having the reaction he wanted?\n\nEdit: When I originally typed this out, I had to step away to the bathroom to type it out. I added in the comments thing’s that I missed during that initial post, so I’m putting the most important answers here in the quotation . Those comments explain why I don’t like pictures.\n\n“He said that he wanted to record my reaction for our memories since he’s never done this before and I’ve never had this done to me. Now I think the idea is cute in theory, but I really don’t like taking pictures of myself. He knows how I feel about cameras and pictures because I literally have to prepare before hand every time I have the slightest clue that I’ll be on camera or that other people will see me. I’ve been like this my entire life.”\n\n“I have to add that we don’t have many pictures together. I really do not like taking pictures. I’ve had too many bad ones from high school and bullying that happened because of said pictures that I’m completely turned off from them.”\n\nI simply do not like pictures and videos that I’m not allowed to prepared for. Especially after driving in the snow storm for an hour. There’s no other deep rooted issues to blame and I don’t hate myself nor how I look. I would’ve been fine taking pictures after I got the chance to decompress, put all my bags down and get out of my snow gear.\n\nSmall Update:\n\nWe talked about it. I apologized for my initial reaction and reminded him on why I reacted that way. He told me that he wanted to make memories and that what I looked like didn’t matter. I’m still working on being comfortable being on camera, but everything is better and no one is upset anymore.\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pa1qwl/aita_because_i_didnt_have_a_reaction/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pa1qwl/aita_because_i_didnt_have_a_reaction/","score":698,"num_comments":143,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764455428.0,"edited":1764482817.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

We had a huge group assignment worth a chunk of our grade. Our lecturer told us clearly that everyone had to contribute fairly and that the group was going to be marked as a whole. The groups were random and I ended up in a group with 3 others I didn’t know, at first everything was okay for the first week or so.\n\nWe made a plan, divided the sections, and set the dead lines for the assignment. I finished my part early and I sent it to the group chat asking if Anyone wanted edits or changes to be made in case they weren’t happy with it. Nobody ended up replying after 2 days so I assumed everything was okay and I shifted my focus to my other courses.\n\nA week later when we met up to combine everything together, I realised that they had rewritten my entire section without even telling me. Not just edited or paraphrased, I mean like completely rewritten my entire work, they started from scratch and replaced it all. When I asked why they said they felt like doing it themselves and that it would flow better and synchronise with their work more, which seemed like an outrage to me because they should’ve just told me if they were working on it together out of uni.\n\nI told them they could have at least told me the rewrote it and they just brushed me off and said it wasn’t personal, but it sure felt personal,\n\nTwo days after that, one of them messaged saying the rewritten section wasn’t good enough and asked me to redo it from scratch. They also wanted it done within a day because the deadline was close.\nI flat out said no. I told them I already did my part, they ignored it, rewrote it behind my back and now they expected me to fix their mess at the last minute?! Who do they think they are thinking that would ever happen. That started a whole argument where they accused me of being lazy, uncooperative and risking their grades, saying just because I didn’t care about education I shouldn’t drag them down with me.\n\nI told them if they didn’t like their version that wasn’t my problem. When I refused again they kept pushing until someone in the group said that they were going to tell the lecturer I was refusing to contribute to the assignment.\nI screenshotted everything, my completed work, the messages, the time stamps, and then emailed my lecturer personally to make them aware of the situation and to send the photos over as proof.\n\nNow the group is furious because the lecturer told them he’d be assessing contribution individually instead of giving one group grade. Now they’re blaming me for so called ‘overreacting’ and in turn punishing everyone else instead of just fixing the situation that the group had. WHICH MIND YOU THEY CAUSED.\n\nI told my parents about it and they said I should’ve just done it to maintain the peace, my mate tho said they’re just using me as a backup and got caught so that’s reassuring in a way.\nSo AITA for not doing the work or no?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p6nze0/aita_for_refusing_to_redo_a_project_for_my_group/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p6nze0/aita_for_refusing_to_redo_a_project_for_my_group/","score":691,"num_comments":118,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764103585.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

She is completely okay with it and says that her friends (who are girls around the same age as us) will join us too. Great. \n\nMy partner arrives around the same time as my sister’s friends and we do introductions and my partner and I let them know that we are just going to the club next door to his friends to see what the vibe is. We leave and hang out there for a mere 20 mins before my phone starts buzzing with texts.\n\nMy sister texts me, “can we join you guys?” and tell her she’s more than welcome. She then says,\n“we want drinks” and I ask her who they want drinks from. She says from my partner or his friends. I ask her why don’t they buy drinks for themselves especially because they didn’t know that the guys will be here until the last minute so I ask what was their initial plan. She then says it’s the rule for guys to buy them drinks and that my partner should get them Hennessy, which happens to be really expensive. \n\nThis made me furious and I left her on read.

I didn’t agree with the purchase, because he wanted to start a personal training business with that singular full body machine. He was excited about renting a small office space (that had no windows), and putting it in there to make money. He’s not a personal trainer either, and we’re surrounded by gyms in our area (3 gyms). He has spent all his savings on this one device that is now and I understand that but I don’t agree with it and the timing of it.\n\nToday I’ve was being colder than usual, because I was exhausted and hurt.

Currently I live with my mom and dad at our family house. My dad is a cool and easy-going guy, however my mom is something different. My mother is a person who is very imperious and usualy demands the things to be done her way without asking for anyone's permission. She is extremely pessimistic person who is looking for problems literally everywhere.  While she is a caring and loving person, she's also toxic to the point where after years and years of fights over the smallest things in our house between her and my father/me, my father and I developed some sort of passive aggressive stance towards her where we subconsciously began dismissing her various shenanigans which usualy made her upset, with her claiming that we're traying to sideline her and make her look like an idiot. It came to the point where on christmas eve after another argument my father threatened her with divorce if she doesn't stop with her toxic behavior.\n\nNow, after years of hard work, I finaly managed to gather enough funds to buy myself an appartment. I talked with the owner and he said that we can visit the appartment in a couple of days in order to see how it looks and so that the housing expert can see it and tell the price. After I announced that, my dad and mom were happy about the fact however my mom said she doesn't want me to leave the house and instead the appartment should be rented out so it could pay the mortgage that comes with it.  \n  \nTommorow is the day on which we go to see the appartment and my mom said that \"we will go to see the appartment\" and she was very excited about it. This is where my passive aggressive stance kicked in again, knowing that my mom would try to find problems and discourage me from buying the appartment, I instinctively said \"You're not coming.\" \n\nMy mom began yelling at me that I see her as nothing and that she's worth less than 0 to me. She began crying and saying that she would give her heart away for me, my safety and comfort and that I broke her heart and treat her like crap instead. I told her that knowing her previous shenanigans, she would discourage me and my dad from buying the appartment, hoping to keep me inside the house and preventing me from making my own choices. I told her that it is entirely my decision this time wether I will buy the appartment or not since I am sick of her making decisions for me or my dad without ever asking us for our opinion. She continued to cry afterwards saying that I don't care about what she has to say and I'm a horrible person. I still told her that she's not coming to see the appartment and I left for my room.\n\nAnd so here we are. I genuinely love my mom, but given the circumstances and history of her actions, I took a cold decision of leaving her out of my appartment visit so I could make the decision on my own for once in my life.

{"id":"1pakuoi","name":"t3_1pakuoi","subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","author":"shelessstry","title":"AITA for refusing to give up the cat I wanted to adopt?","selftext":"It’s going to be a pretty straightforward post, but I seriously need a second opinion, because right now I am so mad I’m second guessing myself.\nI (f20, if that matters), a month ago saw an adoption post for two kittens found on the street. I always wanted a cat, and always wanted to adopt - I firmly believe that it’s a better idea than buying an animal from breeders. Now I finally have the financial means to support an animal, a stable situation regarding living conditions, and support from my family (who I still live with, since I am currently studying in university). Back to the post - I saw it while we were away in our home country due to family reasons, and wrote the woman with the kittens, that I really like one of the girls. She is very calm and tactile by the woman’s words, and has the funniest expressions - if you imagine a cat from the Middle Age paintings, that will be her. \n\nAnyway, the woman answered that she would gladly keep her a little longer so that I can pick her up immediately after getting back home. Yesterday we finally got back - so I also immediately wrote her that hey, I’m finally ready to take my little girl home! She answered that the little one is currently with her friend (temporarily, I unfortunately do not know the word in English for it), and that I can schedule a meeting with her to meet the kitten and discuss when to pick her up. I wrote the woman who currently has the kitten, and we agreed that today I’ll visit her. That should’ve been it, right? \n\nBut, today’s morning, the woman in question wrote me that her nephew and mother don’t want to give the kitten to anyone, and that her nephew is crying since yesterday because he doesn’t want to let the little one go. After that, she offered to “find me a new cat” in the group where other people basically do the same thing - helping to find home to cats from the streets. I wrote that, no, I’m not giving up the cat, and that I could’ve met her in the middle in any other situation, but not this one. I also wrote the woman who found the cat originally, the one who’s been discussing the adoption with (a month ago!!!). She was unpleasantly surprised, and told me that she would speak with her friend immediately, since she didn’t know about this at all. The situation is not solved yet, since it’s only happened today, but I can’t help but think if I’m overreacting? I’m really, really mad, because why should I need to account for the feelings of a child, whose parents (or aunt, in this case), couldn’t explain to him what “temporary” means? I really, really love the kitten, and I don’t want to give her up just because people I don’t know have negative feelings about it. On the other hand, I’m not really known for thinking straight when I’m mad, and I guess I need the opinion from people who don’t know me, so that I can understand If im making a mistake here or not.\n\nSo, I’m I the asshole? \n\nEDIT: I’ve seen many people say it, so I want to clear something up: I won’t “force” my way, try to kidnap the cat, etc. If the situation can’t be solved with words, I’m not going to show up on the foster’s doorstep and demand to have the kitten. But I need to mention that I’ve been in contact with the original “owner” while I was away, texting them nearly every day - and not once during that time the foster, or anyone else for that matter wanted to keep the kitten. Even yesterday the foster agreed to meet, and everything seemed well. Only today did she wrote that the nephew began to cry once she told him that other people would adopt, and that she won’t give her away. She is not the original owner, the owner in question hasn’t been aware about this.\n\nEDIT2: After reading through the comments, I realised that part of the problem with the post in particular is the way I worded it (and writing it in a sense of frustration). English isn’t my first language (nor the second), and I really didn’t know that it would come off that way. I know she isn’t my cat. I know im not entitled to her. I know that it was a verbal agreement, and those can go not as expected. I’m not going to harass the foster, the owner, or anyone else - and I didn’t do it before, I only wrote two messages in total, one to the foster, one to the owner. I’m not going to keep contacting them if it is clear that everything is final. What I actually wanted to know opinions on, is how normal the situation where the foster, without anyone’s knowledge (including the owner), decides to keep an animal just because someone in the family wanted it. NOT an opinion if I should keep pushing my way through if the situation turns out the way I don’t like. But its my fault for not wording it better.\n\nEDIT3: All was resolved. Thanks to those who agreed or disagreed with me politely. Those comments genuinely helped :)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pakuoi/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_the_cat_i_wanted_to/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pakuoi/aita_for_refusing_to_give_up_the_cat_i_wanted_to/","score":525,"num_comments":530,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764516181.0,"edited":1764599639.0,"link_flair_text":"Asshole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Most people have been respectful about not encroaching on our property but some have gotten used to no one being there and have been taking advantage of no one really watching for years. Primarily have been dumping yard waste like grass clippings/tree branches and piles of leaves. Our land is surveyed and pins are visible. \n\nYesterday I happened to look out back when I was eating lunch and notice 3 people with a large tarp walking on our land into the corner of the back part of our property that I’ve been trying to clear out since there was a lot of trees and sticks piled up. I went back with my wife and were yelling to them to stop they are trespassing but kind of ignored us and dumped most of the tarp before we got to them. They got angry and said they’ve been dumping stuff there since they were 10 years old, never met the guy but I guess he grew up there. He went and got his mom who said my wife’s grandma didn’t mind and said they could years ago but there’s no way to prove that as my wife’s grandma is 98 and had a stroke several years ago and is not going to remember.

My friend, we’ll call her Amy, had been asking around other friends and me to stay for a short period while she finds her first solo flat, Of course  having my own place and no roommates I thought it could be great, she would be staying only until she found somewhere to move, I would get to spend some much needed girl time and everything would work out. Now I must say initially everything was going smoothly, she wasn’t messy, helped pay towards her expenses and cleaned up after herself. Now this is where the sofa is involved, my flat has one bathroom, one bedroom and a living space with an open kitchen, in said living space is my sofa/pull out bed, it was a great find on Facebook marketplace when I first moved out and it has been with me since. it’s been great for any sleepovers or guests I have around.\n\nAmy had never brought up wanting me to  ‘donate’ this sofa. This was until 2 weeks ago, Amy finally found her new home just in time for Christmas, Earlier on in her stay we’d had conversations about her moving out and I’d said I would help out as much as I could, I had a bunch of spare cutlery etc I offered her to take to start out and I got to downsize a lil.\nLast week Amy got her keys and began moving her belongings to her new place, while helping her move she mentioned how great it would be to have a sofa bed just like mine and it would make starting out easier.\nI totally understood this as that’s why I was so happy about finding mine at the time I did and started telling her to keep a lookout on marketplace and eventually someone would be getting rid of one, And thats when she just came out with “Well can’t you do that and I can just have yours” I was shocked and honestly just kind of stared at her blankly, at no point had I expressed even thinking of replacing my beloved sofa bed and with Christmas being less than a month away I’m not in a place to be buying a new sofa right now, she proceeded with “ I mean it’s already second hand and you already have a bed so it’s not that bad for you”, as if I’m okay with just having all my friends or family chilling in my bedroom when I have a living space but no sofa there?\nNaturally I told her my sofa isn’t for sale nor would I be gifting it to her and as I just said I’m sure you’ll find one on marketplace or somewhere and she did not take that lightly.\nShe finished packing and moving her things with as minimal communication as possible and as soon as she left she blocked me and complained about my “greediness” and “lack of empathy” to her friends,I’ve received a couple messages from those friends also ripping into me ,so everyone seems to be on her side? \n\nAs of yesterday I found out her parents are helping her pay for a bunch of starter furniture as a house warming/Christmas gift ,which is lovely but I’m still confused why she thought I would give MY sofa up for her.\n\nSo AITA.

I am on the second floor. There are 4 apartments  upstairs (2 in the front, 2 in the back) -- same with the ground floor. 8 apartments total on our side of the building. We are attached to another building that also has 8 apartments. I moved here a year ago and I don't know my neighbors at all. I stay to myself because I suffer from social anxiety. \n\nYesterday morning my husband was leaving our apt. When he opened the door there were several bags of groceries on our porch. Eggnog, eggs, milk, bags of potatos, sour cream, etc. There were no tags on the bag indicating a name or apartment number (which I have received in the past). I brought them in and put the things that needed to be refrigerated in the fridge, still in their bags in case someone came looking for them. I know that when someone delivers groceries for Walmart, they take a picture of the groceries in front of the house/apartment number and it is visible on the Walmart app under their order. I went on the Walmart app and spoke to support in chat and they had no way of telling me whose groceries they were so they told me to keep them. \n\nDespite the fact that I sleep from 6am to Noon, I stayed up and waited in my living room to see if anyone knocked and they didn't so I figured that the person must have just either ordered a replacement or gotten a refund. I went to bed around 11ish. \n\nThis morning I am going to take the trash out before I start cooking for Thanksgiving and my neighbor across the hall stops me and asks me if I received groceries to which I tell her that I did. She tells me that she knocked on my door and no one answered. She asks if I knocked on her door to which I tell her no, instead I placed them in the fridge and waited for someone to knock. She got an attitude with me and told me I should have came to knock. I offered the groceries back to her (I can't eat them anyway because i don't eat dairy) and she tells me to keep them, with a heavy attitude, before calling me an asshole and walking off. \n\nSo AITAH here?\n\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that we have private entry porches separated by doors.

He flew there on Sunday.\n\nHe'd told me he'd call when he gets done with work and their post-work lunch. He couldnt give a fixed time because apparently theres been some transition or acquisition happening, its been hectic for him, so he doesn't know when the day will end for him.\n\nHe called me around 11 pm EST. We talked for a while I asked how his day had been he said it had been a long one. He then asked to see our daughter (she's 3). I told him it was 11 here, she was asleep. He got a bit short with me, said he'd told me he was going to call, that I could have kept her up or given her a nap earlier. I told him she had taken a short nap earlier but at 11, she goes to sleep regardless, and that I had no idea when he'd actually call. He just shook his head with very clear disappointment and said that after a long day he really wanted to talk to her and I could've been more considerate.\n\nThis part stung me because they both are really close to each other, he adores her, and she too is a total daddy's girl. I again said I'm sorry but I had no idea when he would call, if he'd given me some sort of tentative time even that would've helped. We kind of ended the call soon after.\n\nIve been thinking about this all day and been conflicted. AITA?\n\n\nAdding this now: He just texted and said he meant to call during lunch break but got taken out by some executives for lunch. He said he'll call when he gets done at 5 pm his time, so 8 pm ours. I told him that works great.\n\nLast edit: So he talked to our daughter for a good 15-20 minutes, then we spoke too. He was definitely less on edge today than yesterday so I was just going to chalk up yesterday to a long day at work and move past it, but he brought it up and said he was sorry for being short with me yesterday.

Since my sister lives there too and my university gave me a studio apartment that I can pay with student loans, she secretly stayed in this apartment with me for free until the end of my grad program. Independent of that, she also owes me \\~$15k over the span of several years because she didn't make enough money to cover her rent while in medical school. I feel like this context is important to understand why I think I'm not in the wrong.\n\nOnce I graduated we needed to get a new apartment, and my sister purposely went for a 2 bedroom fancy high-rise that was near the hospital she works at that I could TECHNICALLY afford with my meager salary, but not by much. Still, we signed the lease in May 2024 and lived there for a year, splitting the rent so I would pay an eyewatering $2700 a month. When May 2025 came up and we needed to renew the lease, I did it without thinking.\n\nHowever, I was really homesick and not happy with my life. My job was brutal, I missed my friends and family back home, and I hated how goddamn expensive everything is in Boston. When I went to visit my parents in August they were like \"Just move back here and have your sister move to a smaller apartment in the same high rise, and you can pay the transfer fee.\" So I did. Got a job here I like, moved all my stuff, and even paid my half of the rent for a couple more months to give my sister time to move.\n\nShe, however, is furious. Living by herself in a one bedroom means she'll have to pay more for the rent ($3200 instead of us splitting the $5400 rent into $2700 each) and despite making twice my salary as a doctor in a highly prestigious hospital she has NO money saved up. My sister is pretty bougie and loves to buy expensive stuff so its not surprising, but its frustrating how we paid the same rent for over a year, she makes twice the amount of money I do, and yet I somehow have more money saved up than she does. She's also very picky about roommates and originally wanted me to find a new roommate to share the lease with, but I haven't been too successful there. \n\nMy sister proposed that since she has to pay an extra $500 a month because of me moving, I should have to contribute that money to her rent until the time our lease wouldve originally ended (May 2026). I believe that after YEARS of giving her free housing and thousands of dollars, I should be off the goddamn hook. At the very least, let those $500 a month come out of the money she borrowed from me years ago and couldn't afford to pay back. On the one hand I feel bad for her, but on the other hand I'm tired of someone who makes way more than I do financially relying on me for no good reason","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p7dd2h/wibta_for_not_contributing_to_my_sisters_rent/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p7dd2h/wibta_for_not_contributing_to_my_sisters_rent/","score":367,"num_comments":100,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764177127.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I need a third party input.\n\nI (24M) currently live with my parents (53M 50F). I am due to train for a government job (ATC) in like 2 days. I am taking this opportunity to get myself deployed literally anywhere else and leave. \n\nA week ago I agreed to help my mother help my little brother (22M) and his pregnant girlfriend (~21F) move into a different apartment. Mom doesn’t “Trust” me to drive with her in the car and I’ve sinced stopped offering to help her. we’re headed to their old apartment when we realized we were low on gas. She calls her husband to drive up to the gas station we’re at to put gas in the car for her. This is completely normal and I’ve since stopped offering to help him 🤷🏿‍♂️\n\nI realize I have to piss. I let them know, and exit the car. “IN THE GAS STATION!?!?” I hear as I leave. They shout at me from the car to stop and come back, I let them know it’s okay, I’m just peeing, and I will be back. \n\nI enter the gas station, by the time I find the restroom Dad walks in, asking why I was ignoring him, and they gas station bathrooms are dirty, mom will drive me to a cleaner bathroom. I’m getting looks from strangers. I tell him I have to pee, and this is a risk I’m willing to take.\n\nWhen I finish I find mom had driven off, I enter dad’s car and ask where she went. He says she left, because I was disrespectful. I tell him I don’t believe it’s disrespectful to not let someone dictate where and when I pee because they think they’re better than a public bathroom. “What?” He barked, “You said you had to **poop!**”\n\nWhy would I *poop* in a public bathroom? I said. I told him had to pee. He insists I said poop, then goes on to explain by Ignoring them I was incredibly disrespectful, not only to my mother, but as a man, as I walked off and ignored another man as he was speaking to me. I reiterated that random men don’t have a right to dictate when and where I pee, and most normal people would not be this worked up, I add people were giving us looks.\n\nhe just blows off. Tells me from now on, he’ll give me the “Same energy” back. “I’m a grown man, I know how to take care of myself, you don’t know what other people think, you’re still learning”\n\nMore things were said but I honestly don’t have the energy to remember. Ask me a specific question if you wish\n\nWe return home and he stands outside for like 2 minutes before I ask if he’s coming in. “Do your thing” he says. “Okay, want me to close the door?” “I know how to take care of my own garage door.”\n\nLater get a call from mom saying she was *trying* to tell me there was a diner next door I could’ve pissed in, but my disregard for her is hurting her peace. She feels she no longer knows her son. I tell her there’s no reason to get worked up over something so minor, and she hangs up demanding I let her have peace.\n\nWhat did I do wrong here?

I very politely told her we appreciated the invite but already had plans to volunteer at another even that is linked to SO's work. She then asks me to pick a different date in December for SO and I to come up for dinner then since we will not be attending the event.\n\nSome quick context: My SO works a job that is very much not a 9-5. He works a very strange schedule with long hours. This makes planning time with family and each other difficult. For the entire month of December, we only have six days that we are both not busy. Other context is that we got married 3 months ago and this is our first Christmas season being married, and it is also the first Christmas season for our niece (SIL's child who is about 6 months old). Because of our niece we chose to spend Christmas Day with his family. They are also throwing a family \"party\" (the party is just MIL, FIL, BIL, SIL, Niece, and us) earlier in the month that we will be going to. We also live about an hour drive away from MIL.\n\nI called my SO to discuss how he wanted to handle this. He was not able to text her back himself as he was working and cannot answer texts at work. He said to politely tell her we are very busy and that we want to spend the little free time we have together just the two of us. We stay on the phone while I text her. So the conversation goes as follows:\n\nMIL: What day can you come over dinner before Christmas? We want to be able to spend some time with you this month.\n\nMe: Unfortunately, SO and I are super busy this month and at this point they're only a couple of days where we are both free and we want to be able to spend some time this holiday season just the two of us.\n\nMIL: You can't spare two hours in a whole month? :(\n\n(Needless to say SO didn't like that and told me to send the next text as follows so she couldn't claim I ignored her but would hopefully contact him)\n\nMe: I think you should discuss this more with SO. It's more than just two hours for us. It's almost two hours of just driving there and back. We do try to see you guys at least once a month, and next month we are coming down for the party and coming on Christmas Day. We do our best to be fair and see you guys and my family equally while still trying to spend some time together just the two of us.\n\nMIL: See you on the 19th. Don't forget our picture.\n\n(We are meeting before the party to take a family photo with Santa at the mall)\n\nAm I the AH here?? I feel like I make sure we see SO's family pretty frequently. We saw them twice in November and will see them twice in December as well, but with the holidays I wonder if maybe SO and I should sacrifice one more day to spend time with them? But at the same time, I'm only seeing my family once this month so that seems unfair.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1paa37o/aita_for_not_being_willing_to_give_up_one_of_our/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1paa37o/aita_for_not_being_willing_to_give_up_one_of_our/","score":276,"num_comments":83,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764479896.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

He’s one year ahead of me, but he should have graduated two years ago. In his first year of college, he failed all his subjects, and my parents paid a large amount with no results.

Last year, he didn’t study and tried to work different jobs, but none lasted. \n\nNow he has resumed his studies again. In the past, my parents used to pay his tuition through one-time payments, which were cheaper overall.

I had to change our coffee brand at home for a cheaper one, because she was at the house all day, and as me and my girlfriend took one cup of coffee a day, she was drinking 4/5 coffees.

My family plus my husband’s family equals 15 people total. I spoke with my mom today to go over last minute details and when I mentioned the head count she casually mentioned it would be 16 people. When I asked who the 16th was she said it was my uncle. \n\nIt’s important to note that I do not get along with my uncle. He has a very longstanding and pervasive history of substance use, alcoholism, and being manipulative. When I was a child, his addiction was so severe that his wife said he needed to either go to treatment or leave. He chose to leave. He would call my children cousins and tell them that because they didn’t call, they must not love him and if he left this world forever it would be their fault. He would end up in and out of jail and would call my parents begging for bail money. I remember I used to unplug our landline in hopes we’d miss his call. Because my family was on a tight budget and collect calls from jail took away money for us to do fun things as a family. \n\nThen as an adult I’ve watched him financially abuse my grandma. He only ever comes around for money. He stays with her when he’s broke and has no place to go. He’s used drugs on and off throughout my lifetime. He recently almost died in the hospital from complications of his usage. It sickens me that he manipulates my grandmother and my mom doesn’t do anything about it. \n\nSo when my mom told me my uncle was planning to accompany my grandma tomorrow I was livid. I know she purposely withheld his intent to come from me. Because I’ve mentioned the guest list multiple times in the past month and she didn’t correct me.

However, I need volunteer hours for school and found that this church provided easy hours. It also happened to be the same church my Mom goes to, so it felt easier to get in. \n\nSo it was a Saturday night, and I texted a co-pastor to reassure if I would be volunteering the next day (Sunday). He told me that there weren’t any spots available, but I would still be welcomed to show up. After acknowledging his text, and sharing it with my mom, I agreed to show up even if there wouldn’t be anything for me to do (I also texted the co-pastor that I would show up). \n\nNow it’s Sunday morning. I woke up exhausted, couldn’t even open my eyes, and felt like I was on the verge of being sick. I told my Mom, in my exhausted state, that I “was too tired and needed to go back to bed. I can’t go to church today.” She kept replying repeatedly with the same response, “you said you’d go.” I became very fed up with her repetition, and walked away and went back to bed. Once I closed my door, she yelled out “you said you’d go” and then began to cry and slammed her own bedroom door. \n\nOnce I heard her cry, I began to feel very apathetic, because she often has these emotional outbursts over tiny things. In my mind, I was trying to figure out how this even affected her, because she’s not the one I’m “standing up”. Nonetheless,I went back to sleep. \n\nAfter I woke up, I decided to send an apology text to the co-pastor, hoping my mom would later see it too and forgive me. I also asked my father why she began to cry from this, and he said that she was “just disappointed I said I’d go but didn’t.” Also turns out she decided to not go to church either. \n\nI’m not trying to invalidate my mother for her crying, but it felt very frustrating that she started guilting me. Once I felt she was guilting me, that’s when I turned apathetic, because I realized it didn’t affect her at all. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: for further clarification I would like to note that this is the first time I’ve ever “flaked” at this church. I’ve been volunteering for about 4-5 months. I have not apologized to my mother yet because she left the house a few hours ago. My plan is to sincerely apologize once she returns.

For grocery runs, commuting to work, errands, regular household stuff.\n\nThis is the point of the argument. She was very upset that I didn't adjust the mirrors and seating position \"back to how I found it\". Her reasoning was the following:\n\n1. \"When you borrow something, you return it how you (as far as possible) return it in the same condition you found it. eg: if you used 20 dollars worth of fuel, you replace that 20 dollars worth of fuel.\"\n2. \"I shouldn't have to adjust it when it's my car and you are the one who borrowed it. It's your responsibility to re-adjust it back, not mine. If it was your car the situation would be reversed.\"\n\nMy reasoning was the following:\n\n1. we are different heights and very different driving positions. It is therefore literally impossible for me to know the exact positions of the mirrors and driver's seat because my body has different proportions.\n2. It's the responsibility of the driver to check mirrors and seating position EVERY TIME they get behind the wheel --especially if someone else drives the same car because of the above reason.\n\n\\---\n\nOther important details:\n\nIt's a late 2000s Ford SUV with none of the modern trims like auto-adjust seating and mirror positions. I know some more modern cars have features where you can program a specific set of positions for each driver so you don't have to spend time adjusting every time you swap drivers.\n\nThis car didn't have any such features. It doesn't have indicator marks on the seat rack. It doesn't have position indicators for the mirrors. It doesn't have anything like that. It's all old school manual self-adjust.\n\n\\---\n\nShe maintained that I was being pedantic and that I was fobbing responsibility off to her, and that I was being inconsiderate of her and things that belong to her.\n\n\\---\n\nThis isn't the reason why she's now my ex, that was for something completely unrelated. I am just trying to do my due diligence and check myself in case my perception is wrong.\n\n\\---\n\nEDIT:\n\nA lot of people think I never tried to re-adjust anything. I definitely have tried a number of times. There's no programmable positions or anything. It's an older car with completely manual adjusters and no indicators or fine-tune controls. So any adjustments I can make (as far as I have tried) are guesswork. \n\nI even asked her to demonstrate and adjust everything to how she likes it, the re-adjusted it for myself, then tried to re-adjust it back.

I mainly did it to be accessible for my friends 2 of them are local and they both said they could go. But then one of them said they couldn’t go. This friend said she didn’t let her husband go to his friend’s bachelor trip because she was worried about some funny business because it was a Vegas trip and he was with friends who she said are “trouble”. So they apparently made an agreement she cannot go on bachelorettes either to be fair. I tried to compromise with her until she made it clear her husband wouldn’t let her on any overnight trips without him and I’m not about to have a bachelorette trip with her husband. I asked for feedback on this trip since spring of this year and it’s been an endless back and forth of what her husband will and will not allow and it’s so exhausting I basically told her I wasn’t switching more plans and I want an overnight bachelorette and we can still hang out outside my bachelorette.\n\nTalking to my other 2 bridesmaids they are open to Europe, actually one is in London now as she works there and is just coming back to the US for my wedding.

My other friend is very happy as she and her husband wants to visit Europe anyway as they have family so the plan is for her to spend a week with me in Greece and then 2 weeks with her husband visiting family. I think this is the best for everyone as I’m not able to get PTO for the honeymoon until months later so this is my vacation for this year. But my bridesmaid who isn’t able to attend isn’t happy because she feels excluded as I won’t make the bachelorette local and no overnight trips so she can attend. I told her we can hang out and even gave her dates I’m free for a weekend day trip but she is barely talking to me.

I used to visit every weekend, and I’ve always gotten along well with my in-laws. They do have a family friend let’s call him Richard, who is an older, middle aged man and has always been around ever since I met my fiancé. He is usually there from early morning until the evening, almost every day.\n\nAt first it didn’t bother me, but over time it began to feel a bit uncomfortable. Richard comes to every family gathering, holiday, and celebration. Even when my fiancé’s parents went away for the weekend or on holidays and we were looking after the house and pets, Richard would still come over and spend time there. He mainly spends time with my mother-in-law.\n\nHe often shares his opinions and comments on things, and sometimes it can feel a little overwhelming. As the years have passed, it has become harder because I don’t get much one on one time with my in-laws, and my fiancé feels the same about wanting more time alone with his parents.\n\nNow that we finally have our own home, we both agreed that when his parents visit, we would really like it to just be them. Richard is mainly their friend, and we simply want some private family time in our own space. We let his parents know that he is, of course, welcome in their home just not at ours. I really dislike conflict and didn’t want to upset anyone, but it seems that Richard took it personally. Now when we visit my fiancé’s parents for family dinners, he leaves before we arrive, which feels a bit unusual. We’ve made it clear he is welcome in their home if they want him there just not at our place. But I do feel terrible and I hate to be the bad guy in this. But now it feels like he hates me and only me as he believes it was my decision. \n\nFor some background, my fiancé’s sister’s husband felt similarly a couple of years ago because of Richard’s personality and the way he sometimes speaks to people.

So for background - I’m from a pretty close family. I lived at home with my parents and brother until I met my future husband at the age of 29. Now technically we went through the pandemic together, but only officially moved in with him when I was 30. He bought a house about 30 minutes away from my parents without traffic, the longest it has been is about 90 minutes with traffic. My adult brother (31m) still lives with them.\n\nRecently, we were given an opportunity to buy the house of a deceased relative at a nice discount, but the house is about 3 hours total from where my parents are. I acknowledge that my parents (63f and 75m) are unable to make the trip to see me, but I am happy to come to them and always have been.\n\nMy mother, since I’ve told her and disclosed that we are also having trouble getting pregnant and that I am getting fertility treatments, and that I am clinically depressed and in therapy, has completely broken down. She has said that she thought she raised me differently, that she’ll never see us, that I won’t be here for my father, who isn’t well and has a lot of medical issues. I have countered with that now that I work fully from home, I can literally come and stay if she needs me to help out, but she never asks me to.\n\nToday, we had it out while we were cooking (Thanksgiving) and she said she didn’t want anything from me, that my husband doesn’t care about the distance, and that it’s just not how she imagined our relationship, especially with a kid. I said it’s not how I imagined it either but that this is a good opportunity for us.\n\nI should note that where they live is literally one of the most expensive cities in the country and that they live paycheck to paycheck and have for a long time. My husband’s job means that we can’t just pick any random place to live as he brings in most of the money, and I don’t think it’s fair that he’d have to get a new job to make her happy.\n\nI guess right now I just feel trapped.

Shes the most social, outgoing sweetheart of a dog I’ve ever owned. \n\nMy shepherd I’ve had for a few months now, and he was heavily abused before the shelter. I’ve worked SO hard to get him to where he is now. People= eyes on me and you get a treat. We’re still working on the dog reactivity. \n\nAnother issue for another day is my landlord is taking our construction project OUTSIDE as a free for all to come inside the house without asking. The first time she came over we gave permission as we had a large leak in the ceiling. She then was trying to get us to allow her to “have a relationship with the dogs”. I shut this down. \n\nThe next time she came around, I let them meet her (they met when we started the lease, but the dogs wanted nothing to do with her), and the first thing she does is stick her hands in my shepherds face and will not stop. So I called him over to me and told him his command to stay next to my side. She didn’t understand why I did this. \n\nShe then tries again to say she’s great with our dogs and she wants them to know her so she can come in if she needs to if we are not home.

This morning at 7am while I’m on my way to college she states it’s very urgent she goes into the house to check on the new leak (which I told her had stopped due to the snow being done melting). I said absolutely not, the dogs are in the living room and I don’t know how they’d react to someone walking into the house without us home. She then says that she’s going to take her chances and go in anyways. So I said I’m turning around. \n\nShe comes in. And talks about the contractor. Doesn’t even look at the leak. Then leaves. Which proves my theory that she keeps doing this because she wants to snoop in my house and potentially see how far she can get with the dogs. \n\nMy husband doesn’t want me to send her a message stating entry without 24 hr notice + our consent is both illegal and against our contract. He wants to keep the peace. I want to keep our dogs safe and my home free from being walked in like it’s a museum. This has sprung arguments over the last two weeks so.. AITA??

In our class, it's 21 girls and 5 boys, meaning that usually we (the boys) tend to sit together in class.\n\n  \nThe English teacher said that for our final semester we'd be doing an interview speaking project (Important to note I'm not from an English speaking country) in which in pairs we'd have to do a video interviewing each other. After she explained the project, we had to choose pairs.\n\n  \nMy friend (17M) asked if he could do the project with him. Now, I have the best English level in my class and ever since Junior Year of HighSchool I've been doing my English group projects with him and I've basically been carrying him, which I don't mind since he's a cool guy. So it was only natural I agreed to do the project with him.\n\n  \nHowever, as we had to turn in our tests that she had also given. Another friend (17F) asked if she could do the project with me, since her friend group in class is 3 people and thus she was left out. Moreover, while the other 2 girls have a good level of English, she clearly doesn't, so she asked me if I wanted to do the project with her.\n\n  \nNow, I'm closer friends with her than with him, since we went on a student exchange program together. And I had never done an English project with her, so I accepted her proposal. However, this meant now I had to tell my other friend that I wouldn't be doing the project with him.\n\n  \nThus, at the end of the class I told him I wasn't doing the project with him. And he got very mad, he called me a traitor, an asshole, and told me that if I went through with that he would not talk to me ever again. Even worse, he would be paired with another classmate (17M) and, let's just say they both really hate each other. I told him I would write the script for his interview if he wanted, as a way to at least make him feel better, but he rejected.\n\n  \nEver since then he doesn't say hi to me, he refuses to shake my hand (ironically he shakes the hand the guy who he hates) and has created somewhat of a bad mood between the 5 boys of the class, since he constantly avoids talking to me in any way shape or form.

Adam moved away to go to university for his freshman year, but moved home after that to take classes online because he was having trouble adjusting. He has terrible anxiety, to the point he takes medication daily to be able to go out and run errands/drive/etc, so we had no problem with him continuing working on courses from home. He was doing great and keeping an A average, so we worked out a deal. Husband and I both work full time, but we work close enough to each other that we can carpool. If Adam kept up his grades, attended the doctor appointments every few months to monitor his medications, and helped with the odd task at home, we'd give him my car to use as his own. Note, Adam didn't want to drive until just before leaving for college, and lived on campus so didn't need a car freshman year. \n\n\n\nBy tasks I mean picking up a sibling from a sports practice maybe once a month, pulling something from the freezer to thaw for dinner so I could make it once we got home from work, or taking the dogs out at night if he was still up late rather than them waking me to go outside. All the boys rotated through who took the trash from the kitchen to the outside trash can, and I sometimes asked for help with vacuuming or dusting from everyone equally because no boy will move out not knowing basic housekeeping skills. Adam would volunteer to go out with his brothers and drive them places or they would all go to hang out at the mall.\n\n  \nLife was great until about three months ago. Adam has decided he wants nothing to do with any of us, especially his brothers. He dropped out of classes this semester, stays up all night on his computer to then sleep most of the day, and is nasty to everyone. He is now demanding I cancel the upcoming doctor appointments, doesn't want to take any medications, and finally admitted that some of the time when he is out at random times it's because he got a job delivering pizzas. Our problem is that we're still paying for the insurance, registration, tires, repairs, and most of the fuel being used for this job because it barely pays anything. In addition, it's a safety hazard for Adam to drive if he's not taking medication, as in his license can be revoked by the doctor. \n\n  \nHusband and I sat him down and laid our concerns on the table regarding the safety problems, the fact this job is a money pit for us, and tried to find out what's actually going on for the Nth time, but Adam yelled at us for meddling and stormed off.

My mom (45) and my sister (22) are visiting me for 10 days. This is not the first time : last year she stayed 15 days. She never asks me how long she can stay; she just assumes. She sees these visits as a way to take a break from being a mum and having fun. \n\nContext number 1 : my mum is Turkish (a culture, where hospitality is big). I am born in Germany and navigate between those two cultures. I am also the oldest daughter and the first academic so add that to the lovely mix of complex family dynamics. \n\nAs a preparation for their stay, I made some room in the apartment and booked vacation time so I would not get extra stressed. I also tried to be less nit picky about cleanliness. \n\nDuring the visit, she expects me to spend all my free time with her and my younger sister (which I was fine with). My middle sister also lives in the same apartment complex in a similarly small room. I was fine with my little sister and my mum sleeping over at my place as long as they cook over at my middle sister‘s place. \n\n\nContext number 2: My middle sister is closeted and can’t fully be herself around our mom, but my mom seems to prefer this because it’s easier and less complicated. She is also the one who gives my mum the \"princess treatment“ by marking barely any boundaries and always defending her against us and spoiling her. Meanwhile, I constantly have to manage schedules, set boundaries, and maintain my own space, and when I do, my mom complains that I’m “too tense” or “too formal.” She asked me once outright \"Why are you setting all those boundaries with me?“. I said that I was just marking my capacity and did not want to lash out like during one of her visits in the past. I had made her cry back then in the middle of a cafeteria (long story short: she turned all of the family members against me and piggy backed on her victim status for a long time). Her reply? \"Do you want me to cry and go over to your sister‘s place?“. \n\nShe also stirs up tensions , for example, making comments comparing me to my middle sister or idealizing my cousin, who she visits frequently , and expects me to go along. She stirs small conflicts, makes passive-aggressive remarks, and doesn’t respect my time or routines (like mornings, showering, etc.). This past visit, I became sick from the stress. And this is not my first time getting sick. The last time I was sick to the point of not being able to get out of bed for two weeks straight. \n\nI love my family, but I feel like she is emotionally manipulative, disregards my space, and prioritizes comfort and control over respecting me. So I want to know: Am I the asshole for enforcing my boundaries and expecting basic respect during her visit?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p8xcvx/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_mom_during/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p8xcvx/aita_for_setting_boundaries_with_my_mom_during/","score":77,"num_comments":43,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764343029.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

People always pointed it out, with comments like \"you should eat more\". I was always insecure about this. They would hold my wrist and say how it's so small. Classmates would make fun of the size of my PE uniform, which would be kids sizing even if we were in high school. I don't mean to be like those skits in TikTok that are like \"ohhh I'm so small uwu\". But I truly was made fun of for being skinny. And it really affected my self-esteem. I once borrowed a friend's shirt and she told me it made me look anorexic. The thing is, I'm not. I eat well and tried my best to gain weight.\n\nWhen I was around 16, my friend and I were called to the clinic for our yearly check up, where they check our height, weight, and etc. For some reason, we were in the clinic together and I was first so my friend heard the nurse's feedback. I was told that my BMI was underweight and I should eat more. Which, okay, is factually true. I left and waited for my friend outside. Now, this \"friend\" was always one of the people who would make fun of me for being skinny. At one point, she said she thinks I'm skinny enough that she can break my arm. She implied that I was weak multiple times. I was/am a runner and do sports. When she went out the clinic, she said \"Good news! I'm healthy! Not like you. Not underweight!\". I said \"Oh, I wouldn't have thought ~~so~~ you're underweight\". Which she got offended by. She's not overweight or anything, she's pretty much healthy and average. She was conscious about gaining weight in high school and always spoke about body positivity and female empowerment, but I guess not when it comes to skinny people. She said I bodyshamed her for saying she doesn't look underweight.\n\nWe've since graduated, and are no longer in contact, but it's been brought up recently by a mutual friend when we were reminiscing about high school. Apparently, friend ranted to her about it.\n\nTL:DR: In high school, a \"friend\" who constantly made fun of me for being skinny overheard my checkup at the clinic where I was told that I was underweight. She shared her own results with me and said \"I'm healthy! Unlike you! Not underweight\". And I said I wouldn't have thought she's underweight, which offended her and she claims bodyshaming.\n\nAITA?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pb0w43/aita_for_bodyshaming_my_friend/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pb0w43/aita_for_bodyshaming_my_friend/","score":74,"num_comments":29,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764556241.0,"edited":1764556577.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I’ve worked hard to manage it, and you wouldn’t know if I didn’t tell you. My husband (43 M) is very close with his family. His parents live 6 hours away, and 2x a year we go down for big family gatherings. We usually stay 5 full days plus 2 travel days. We used to stay at his aunt’s, but now we stay with his parents. They have two extra bedrooms: one closed-door room that my brother-in-law and his wife use, and the other is a loft where my husband and I sleep. The loft has no door. You can’t see into it, but you can hear everything. My husband snores, sometimes so loud that at home I end up in our spare room. When we visit, there is constant socializing. We go house to house with the same large extended family all day. My social battery drains fast, and I take alone walks to avoid getting overstimulated. I love his family. But I have a very hard time sharing bathrooms. I deal with severe constipation and get extremely self-conscious spending so much time in someone else’s bathroom. My in-laws have one common bathroom and another inside their bedroom, which they don’t mind people using, but I feel awkward going in there. My MIL also has a chronic cough that’s much worse in the mornings. For the past few years, sleeping there has been incredibly difficult..between my husband’s snoring and her coughing, I’m awake multiple times a night/morning. She tries to stay in her room longer so she doesn’t wake us, but because the loft has no door, every sound travels. I use earplugs and a noise machine, and I still get jolted awake. The TV room is directly under the loft, so once people wake up, I hear everything. My husband tells me I can “go up to the loft” for alone time, but that feels strange when we’re there to visit. At home I need quiet time after social events to decompress. On these trips, I get almost no alone time and barely any real sleep. My anxiety spirals. I want to enjoy visiting his family. I have a stressful job and limited vacation time, and I use a big chunk of it for these visits. I come back more drained than when I left. So I asked my husband if I could get a hotel room just to sleep. The hotel is less than two miles away. I’d spend the whole day with his family, but at night I’d have quiet, a bathroom I can actually use, and the ability to mentally “turn off.” When I brought it up, he said: “You’re not getting a hotel room, that’s ridiculous,” and “Do you know how hurt my parents would be?” He told me I “need to get over this stuff.” His solution was sleeping in the walk-in closet, which is even more ridiculous. He says he wants me there as his wife, but I need him to consider my mental and physical health. When I don’t sleep, everything suffers. AITA for spending a few nights (not xmas Eve) in a hotel so I can actually sleep and, honestly, poop in peace? I’m looking for outside perspectives on how to do this without offending his family while still taking care of myself.\n\nEdit: my husband offered to stay in the closet because he wants me there so bad.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p79l55/aita_for_staying_at_hotel_instead_of_my_inlaws/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p79l55/aita_for_staying_at_hotel_instead_of_my_inlaws/","score":76,"num_comments":101,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764168466.0,"edited":1764176999.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I am the 2nd of 4 boys in my family, and my brother that is graduating is kid number 3. My oldest brother, kid 1 (M30), is also flying in and the whole family is going to the graduation. Now for the back story. \nMyself and 3 don’t have a good relationship. Things were said at my wedding that I have not been able to forgive him for, and he believes that he was right. He basically said that I wasn’t ready to get married and that the Holy Spirit told him so (I am a Bible school graduate so there isn’t much I know about the Holy Spirit, but I know contradictory isn’t one of its traits). Anyways, long story short I have set up boundaries with brother 3 and will not attend family functions when he is present. However, I messed up and didn’t think about his graduation. That’s my bad. \nA few months before the graduation, it seemed that everybody in the family was pushing for me to be there. I resisted at first with the reasoning being “if brother 3 wants me there I will happily go, if he doesn’t I won’t” but brother 1 told me that he believes he is right anyways and won’t acknowledge his wrongdoings, no matter how prevalent they might be. I agreed and also agreed that this moment was a huge accomplishment for him and that I should attend either way. Brother 1 and I also agreed that if I got a rental car then he would get the hotel. Now here is where things get messy. \nAbout a month ago, I was informed that the ceremony had been moved from Saturday to Sunday. This change meant that I had to change my flights. I cannot afford to miss work so I had to cancel my flights and rebook flights to fly out Sunday night on the last flight out. Brother 1 thinks that I am a “hopeless and helpless asshole” for not being willing to give brother 3 “the entire day” for his graduation. I told him that I couldn’t afford to miss work because my wife and I are basically poor, and he said that I could “try to make more sacrifices” so that I could be there all day Sunday. \nNow I understand people have different views and relationships, and I try to abide by them and not push my opinions onto others. I offered to leave him the rental and get a ride to the airport so he could stay all day. He told me he will not be getting behind the wheel of the rental, nor would he be asking anybody for a ride to the airport because “he wouldn’t want to do it so why should he ask anybody to do it for him” (the drive is about an hour away). \nI told him that my answer was no that I couldn’t stay Sunday, and that he was an asshole for getting my answer of no and proceeding to push harder to make me “try”.\nSo Reddit, I could use some help because I am starting to second guess myself now and I don’t know what to think or believe.

I haven’t been to the gym in about a year and a half due to a knee injury and I’ve just recently started going again. My previous boyfriend was an athlete, when we were dating he bought me all my gym clothes from his team store. They’re very good quality and were much cheaper than similar alternatives, however they do have the logo of his team on them, obviously at the time I didn’t care but my current boyfriend had a real issue with this. \n\nLast week when I got the green light from my doctor regarding my knee I dug out all my gym clothes, A asked me what the logo on them was and I explained the situation to him. A says he doesn’t want me wearing those and that I need to get rid of them. I told him that I won’t be doing that, as to replace all these clothes would be like £300, I’m a uni student so money is tight and I just can’t justify spending so much on gym clothes when I have plenty of perfectly fine ones right here. He really didn’t like this answer and said he won’t come to the gym with me while I’m wearing these and that he feels disrespected, I said he’s welcome to buy me some new clothes if he has such a problem with them but he didn’t respond. So, I’ve been wearing my old clothes with the logos on to the gym for the past week and things are tense. \n\nAm I wrong for how I’m reacting? I can partially understand why A is upset, but the reality is that I can’t justify spending £300 on new clothes right now. I was hoping he’d just be mature enough to leave it and be happy that I’m healed up and able to go to the gym again. Edit: Am I an asshole for not throwing away the clothes from my ex and replacing them with worse quality ones? AITA?

That’s fine with us. \nWe are three months in having the 13yo I’ll call Josie. Josie is doing okay at our house and my partner and I are struggling on what kind of rules - boundaries we need to set. One of which is her time to be home. We were playing this by ear but had run into her coming home past curfew on school nights and not telling us about staying somewhere\nWe had a conversation with Josie and set the rules and said we would work on them as needed. Curfew is 7. \nFast forward we have her missing curfew and bringing home bad grades\nThis results in her being grounded no phone and home all day after school for a week\nThis just so happens to land on the county fair\nTwo days into her grounding we go soft and let her go with her aunt and uncle/ I’ll call Beth and Jason. Beth and Jason have her older sister so they are a part of this child sharing. \nThey take her to the fair and spend all night out not even hanging out with her, they let her run around with her boyfriend Two days later they want to take her back to the fair & we let her go. It’s hard to say no to visiting family\nShe gets ungrounded and about two weeks go by and she is late again, waits around 30 minutes past curfew to get with us & turning her location off. Her excuse was that her ride back to us bailed on them so it took longer walking back\nThe next day she is late again, I (aunt) call her five minutes after curfew and she hangs up on me and sends a text saying she is with Jason and Beth. I let her know that I didn’t care where she was & I was coming to get her because she was late again. She understood and I was on my way to pick her up Jason text me and said she was at their house and they would bring her home after a movie I let him know that it was the second day in a row she was late so I was coming to get her. He said that they had it planned for a while and he would bring her home after, again I said no she broke the rules we were nice twice when she was grounded last time and let you guys have her but now she isn’t taking her rules seriously. \nI drive to his house and call Josie to let her know I was there. Jason takes her phone and hangs up on me & sends a text saying she wasn’t coming out so I go up and knock on the door they do not let me in and tell me to leave, I do. This caused a big family fight and I am being accused of going on a power trip. Was that a power trip?

This revolves around my older sister, who I'll call Jane.\n\nThe joke in the family is that Jane was swapped at birth and that somewhere out there a very smart, bookish family has a jock daughter. My parents are athletic sports nuts and so are my brother and I. Jane runs to be healthy but otherwise, I think a good way to sum it up is that we would be having our superbowl party and Jane would be doing piano prodigy level playing in the other room. She's super smart, always has been, and is her own person. Was valedictorian and eventually wound up with a PhD in classical studies. My parents always supported her and made her feel included. This isn't speculation. She's said so. As I've gotten older I've appreciated it more. She's taken me to see some cool stuff in museums and and has found niche things that I've really enjoyed that I wouldn't try otherwise.\n\nI also have two sister in laws- Jane's wife and my brothers wife. Jane wanted to go see a movie recently, some insane limited release Japanese animation that was about religion maybe; I don't know. Her wife (who is like Jane) was even like \"no not for me\". Jane was happy to go by herself but my other sister in law (I'll call her Grace) said she would go with her since Jane and my brother live in the same city. Jane said she would be happy for her to go, just to be aware it might not be her thing and that she'd be glad to go to a different movie another time with Grace. Grace said she was good to go. Side note, Grace is very unlike my sister. Sorority girl, into social media, etc. That's fine! They are just polar opposite. Grace sometimes doesn't \"get\" Jane though. \n\nGrace lasted all of 15 minutes of the movie before she told Jane she wanted to leave. Jane said that was fine; but she was staying to finish. Grace doesn't like to take public transit by herself at night and then was forced to sit through the movie, though I think she could have just chilled in the lobby on her phone. This really upset Grace. \n\nThis was shortly before Thanksgiving and Grace brought it up again during the holiday and was really kinda laying into Jane, saying how could she do that and it was rude etc. Joking but not joking, you know? I said \"Oh we can't all be like General Egghead, sorry\" and gestured to Jane; trying to sort of end the convo. \n\nWell according to my brother, Grace thought I was calling her stupid and now wants me to apologize. I wasn't, just wanted her to stop bothering my sister. I don't want to cause tension with my brother. Should I apologize? Did I call her stupid? AITA? \n\nEdit- Jane got back to my text about what the movie was called. Angel's Egg? Also, should have mentioned- we grew up in Boston but Jane, her wife, my brother and Grace all live in NYC.

He’s a nice guy and we’ve lived together for 3 years and part of the arrangement is that his kid is allowed to stay with us sometimes. All well and good but his kid likes to play with poop. It’s been 3 years of finding small spots and sometimes larger spot of shit around my bathroom. We have had talks about it and even keep wipes just for them to clean the bathroom but it’s an ongoing situation and now that his kid is also using an electric toothbrush the mess is ridiculous.

Yes his kid is special needs but he’s also a teenager who is capable of more than his parents put on him.

Cousin lost her dad 1.5 years ago to cancer. I wasn't close to my uncle and kept some distance from my cousin because of her attitude and disrespect.\n\nWhen my uncle was sick, I took my cousin out to help get her mind off of things. I did this 2-3 times a month till my uncle passed then started seeing her as much as I could (at her request) until she pushed me past my boundaries. One day, I told her I couldn't stay for dinner because I had a dinner with our uncle that I forgot about. She looked at me funny and goes, \"You know, if our uncle got cancer and died, I wouldn't feel sad\". I told her, \"Thats a bit harsh\". She goes, “Doesn’t mean it isn’t true” and asked how our pregnant cousin was and I said fine, just normal symptoms. She responds with, \"I hope she loses the baby\". To which I said, \"That’s really rude. Just because you don’t like kids doesn’t mean the rest of the world has to.” My cousin then says something like, \"We don't need more kids in the world. Its why Jess shouldn't have been born.\" Jess is my sister's daughter. I was pretty furious at this point and told her that that was crossing a line and to not speak about my family like that. She rolled her eyes then made a comment about the show we were watching. I stewed for a bit but tried to just get through the rest of our hangout. Basically, after that I stopped initiating hangouts and she never did, so we rarely saw each other. Also, I didn’t usually call her out on her behavior before all of this because before I didn't feel like it was my place and I'm bad at confrontations. Sometimes I do ask her to explain what she meant or repeat what she said, kind of a psychological tactic. \n\nSince then, I'd text her to let her know that she can reach out if she needs anything. Fast forward to now, we have a wedding to attend at a resort and her mom isn't going. Cousin asked to stay with me since I'm not sharing with anyone and her mom offered to pay for half (cousin unemployed). She wouldn't be able to go if she didn't share a room because her mom won't pay. I'm still very upset by her comments about our family and her general attitude towards everyone around her. I understand that losing a parent is a different type of grief but that doesn't give you the right to say whatever is on your mind or to act out or just be rude to people. Most of my time with her was draining because it would just be her venting to me about all her problems in life, all the relatives who she despises, all the friends she cut out. I tried hard to listen, to offer advice, to just be there, but its hard when its just a constant negative energy around me. She never even asked about my own life. I'm not trying to dismiss her grief or past experiences at all but I'm frustrated with how she is choosing to cope (or not cope).

My sister (21F) also flew down to visit. We hadn’t decided when we were going to leave (Saturday morning or Sunday afternoon) since I wanted to see first how the trip was going. My family isn’t the best to be around sometimes. Friday afternoon my mom asks when we’re leaving because my sister now wants to leave early, so we agree to leave Saturday. My mom called me around nap time so I wasn’t able to get all the details or talk to my husband but I knew he would be okay with taking my sister to the airport. Later that night we saw them for dinner so we asked for them to be ready to leave by 8-9 am so we can get home before dark and put my son to bed at a reasonable time. That’s when things went south… no one agreed with our plan. My dad said that he didn’t want my sister to be at the airport alone for 4 hours (her flight leaves at 5 and is 3 hours away from where we are), my sister said she didn’t want to wake up that early, and my mom just went along with whatever my sister said. I tried to explain to them that since dropping her off is OUT of our way home by 2 hours we’d like to leave early since it’s already going to take us extra time to get home since I constantly have to pee and my toddler needs diaper changes and we have to get lunch somewhere. It’s also supposed to rain all day so that’ll add even more time since we’ll be driving slower. On our way here it took us almost two extra hours with all the stops we made. Total to get to my dad’s it took us 7.5 hours. This caused my dad to yell at my husband saying that he was hoping we’d do him the favor of taking my sister instead of making him drive and my sister also getting upset saying I was being rude/an AH for making my dad drive her, since they all refuse to wake up early to eat breakfast together so we can leave by 8-9 am. Am I the asshole for just asking to leave early? I get that being at the airport for 3-4 hours before your flight isn’t ideal but we’re not saying we don’t want to drive her, we really don’t mind, but we’d just like to leave early.\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone who commented. I was starting to feel like I was in the wrong.

We certainly weren’t poor but my brother (26M) and I (32M) both went to school on a lot of financial aid and a lot of holes were patched with credit card debt, which generally left the two of us pretty anxious about money growing up. After college I graduated and was lucky to get a good paying job, but my younger brother graduated from college after Covid and even after going to grad school has been having a really hard time finding a good full time job in his field. He’s been working hard in a part time service job that he often has to be at around 5 am, but it’s not enough to live on in NYC even with a roommate.\n\nLuckily, my parents came into some money from a relative passing and have been able to support him and help him pay the rent, which I’ve had no issues with until recently. A few months ago, I learned offhand that my brother was saving and actually had quite a lot in savings. And by a lot, I mean tens of thousands of dollars. I also found out that my parents were supporting him a lot more than I thought. I assumed they were paying part of his rent, but they’re actually paying all of it and then some. I’d been feeling weird about it and finally asked my dad, why he was giving my brother that much in support if he was able to save after paying living expenses and apparently my dad didn’t know he’d been saving. Now I think he’s thinking of reducing the amount my brother gets.\n\nI’ve never gotten money from my parents except for help with a down payment that I repaid them with interest. The thing is I really don’t need help. I have a very comfortable six-figure job that I worked hard to get, but is probably objectively less taxing than my brother‘s job. It feels petty given the circumstances to worry about the money my brother is getting when he’s not being lazy and is certainly not living a life of luxury with it. At the same time, I can’t shake the feeling of something being unfair about my brother getting tens of thousands of dollars a year from my parents in support while I’m getting nothing, even though I really don’t want anything from them.\n\nNow I’m worried that my brother is going to think I’m the AH for getting his support reduced when at the end of the day, the money makes a much bigger difference to him than to me. AITA for not just keeping my mouth shut?\n\n  \nEDIT: I should clarify because I want to give a clear picture of the situation that when I said came into “some money”, I really meant a lot of money.

My girlfriend and my best friend both obviously really wanted me to go, so I was invited. When I was invited, it was around May of this year. I tried to encourage the planning process by asking everyone to sit down and discuss the trip (as it's a long, complex international trip) but nothing came of it. I kept asking, as I needed to get some form of budget for my mum. \n\n\n\nI was unable to afford the trip by myself of course, as I am 18 and work a part time job and didn't have that long to save. I was unable to get that budget, despite my asking, as my girlfriends mum just wouldn't sit down with us and try to book it. Because of this, I was doubtful the trip would go ahead, however I still went out and got my passport. As the months went by, and it got closer to December, I kept asking again and again for a budget, as my mum needed one in order to organise her finances. \n\n\nWhen it got to October, my Girlfriend's mum kinda freaked out and realised she needed to book immediately, and gave me a deadline of one day to pay for everything. I did not meet this deadline. I could pay for the airfares, but since there was no budget still for the accommodation while in Europe, my mum was hesitant. The length of the holiday was extremely long, which wasn't communicated to me, and I was still unable to get a budget and was told to just calculate the average room price. \n\n\nI communicated that I would be unable to afford it, and was trying to figure something out so that I could go with my mum, who was away internationally for work. Then, my girlfriends mum realised that it was too expensive, and then shortened the holiday significantly, without telling me. She then told me I would have to contact the travel agent myself to tell her if I could come, because apparently everything was booked. \n\n\nMy girlfriend and my best friend, still really wanting me to come tried to use their inheritance money to pay for me, so that me and my mum could pay it back. I then contacted the travel agent and told her I could come, and she said that was no issue and that nothing was booked. Although I really wanted to come, I was uncomfortable with borrowing money from my friend and girlfriend, so I understand why my girlfiriends mum was completely against it, and thus that didn't go ahead. \n\n\nDuring all of this time that I was trying to figure out if I could come, which was around 3-5 days post deadline, the airfares went up significantly as it was very close to December, and now my girlfriends mum is upset with me, and is trying to ban me from housesitting for them while they're away. My best friend and girlfriend are on my side, but their mother doesn't want to talk to them and is just ignoring them basically. I feel bad that the prices went up, but I feel like it's not my fault as I tried to book earlier.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p8l3el/aita_for_delaying_the_booking_of_a_trip_and/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p8l3el/aita_for_delaying_the_booking_of_a_trip_and/","score":57,"num_comments":25,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764302028.0,"edited":1764378661.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I (22F) am a second-year student currently for what many would consider a 'fake degree' (Religious studies and the like.. (I love my degree dw)). There is one class where the professor is extremely difficult.\n\nThis professor said at the beginning of the course that instead of an exam at the end, he will assign a 500-word essay every week based on the reading. The assignments have 5 days to be done and the reading is LONG (I also work almost full time and take 7 other classes). He also said multiple times that we cannot use AI for our assignments. Here's the doozy, me (and my friends in the insta poll I just did on my private story) agreed that this means do not use AI to write any version of the essay, even bullet point form.\n\nI made the mistake of using AI to summarise the 45-page essay he gave us so that I can read it better in order to write only about what's relevant. I then made the far stupider mistake of writing one of the quotes ChatGPT presented to me as factually included in the article. I looked in the article for the words used in the quote, as it felt too good to be true and I found it.

For context, I have a very fraught relationship with my family and have mostly disengaged with them over the years, but they put in more effort lately so I started attending more events. My grandma is also getting older so I want to spend more time with her. The reasons for my disengagement is that I feel like me (and my siblings) have been treated more unfairly compared to my cousins, but I am just using this as background on why I got more upset than I should have.\n\nMy cousins and my sister & BIL came over early in the morning because they were going to a movie I had already seen. I had drove in earlier yesterday, picking up my sister and BIL from the city, and stayed overnight so I can drive them back as public transport would be long and annoying. I waited to have lunch until they arrived and was in the guest room, but they never called me before they started eating. I heard them eventually and came out, my cousins greeted me with “Good morning” as I walked in and I greeted her back “Good morning” and asked what dishes were out.\n\nAs I sat down to eat one of my aunts (not the mom of my cousin or owner of the house), said I need to greet my older cousins with a cultural phrase. I said I had already told them good morning, and she said no I had to greet them with a specific phrase. Again I said I think it’s fine but she wouldn’t drop it. So I went and said the phrase to all of them (slightly sarcastically) and sat down again. My aunt took my plate of food and said I wasn’t welcome in this house if I don’t say it properly. So I said fine I will leave then. \n\nI went to grab my coat and things and as I was walking out my cousin told me I should just say the phrase as a cultural thing towards my elders. I told her I had told her good morning, and that my younger siblings didn’t say the phrase to me and no one said anything to them, I don’t find it a big deal. She said no they should, but again I do not think she understood the double standards? No one has taken someone’s plate and ordered my siblings out because they didn’t say it to me, I wouldn’t care anyway. My cousin and me argued about it, I said I didn’t need this drama in my life and she said I was the one creating the drama by storming out. My sister agreed with her and my other cousin mumbled I should say it to be nice. For context, I had greeted them all with that phrase yesterday when I arrived.\n\nI left the house and drove home.

So my aunt (52f) throws a very large birthday party every year, and her birthday is coming up next week. She's very insistent that everybody in the family comes regardless of the circumstances, and often gets very upset if somebody can't make it for whatever reason. But I'm really considering just not going this year. She's very much a \"family sticks together\" person, which I admire, but I feel like she just throws that phrase around in everyone's face if they have to miss an event. \n\nI have two sisters. My older sister (25f) is extremely busy, working insanely late hours and she has a little girl that she's raising by herself because her ex is an absolute deadbeat. My younger sister (21f) is in college, and as if she's not already under stress, she's still recovering from mental health issues she had as a teenager. Won't go into details on those, but it really wasn't good. In addition, my father (58m) has undergone a string of health issues... he's recently had surgery, and he has heart problems, and he has become quite forgetful these past couple years, so he needs somebody with him a lot to get him to eat and take his medicine, etc. Because my sisters are very busy, that person is usually me. \n\nOk, sorry for dumping all that on you, but it feels necessary. My sisters have both had to miss family events earlier this year, and my father, in his condition, obviously can't go, and my aunt has just been so inconsiderate about it, my sisters have said that she has called them crying and said they don't care about family and things similar to that. I know my aunt, and I'm sure some of these were just said out of frustration and she didn't really mean it, but it just really gives me a weird feeling. I'm kind of angry at my aunt for being so rude to my sisters and father, but I don't want to be the one who causes drama by bringing it up, because I know it's just going to be super messy. I don't want my sisters or father to be any more stressed than they already are, and same goes for some of my other aunts, uncles, and cousins. I don't want to put my pride or emotions before peace in this family either. At the same time, it is SO TEMPTING to just unleash all this on her.

Any time he eats something outside that plan, he gets sick for days and i spend a lot of money treating him. \n\n\n\nMy next door neighbor Dana she is in her mid 50s is retired and spends a lot of time gardening on her front porch. She’s always been friendly, and when I first moved in she complimented Milo constantly. I was okay with that until she started leaving treats on my porch for him. Not handing them to me or even asking me if it was good for him. The first time, I explained that he can’t have random treats that's outside his diet because it makes him sick and thanked her but said please don’t leave any more. She apologized and seemed totally fine with it.\n\n\n\nThen it happened again the next week. Different treat even after i explained to her it wasn't good for him, Milo grabbed one before I even noticed, and sure enough he got sick again. I went over with the bag and reminded her gently that he can’t eat anything not approved by his vet. She said, Oh honey one little biscuit won’t hurt him. I told her it actually does and still explain he gets sick after eating anything outside his diet and i spend a lot of money treating him. \n\nLast week I came home from work and found three treats on the porch all different kinds. At that point I was frustrated and honestly worried Milo was going to end up at the emergency vet. I knocked on her door and still explained to her politely, not yelling that she absolutely cannot leave food on my property for my dog anymore because it makes him sick and he always ends up in the vet after eating the treats and if it keeps happening I’ll have to block off my porch or involve animal control guidance because it’s affecting his health. She got upset and said I was accusing her of poisoning my own dog.\n\nSince then she’s been giving me the cold shoulder, not even answering me when i great her and she is talking to other neighbors about how I’m dramatic and hateful for not letting her be kind to my dog who is on a specific diet, One neighbor even asked why I scolded an old lady. \n\n\n\nI honestly don’t know what else I’m supposed to do.

And with refusing a home, she also expects everyone to care for her. Using my nan like nothing else.\n\nNow, my grandma is not a nice woman. She name calls, argues about everything, expects to be treated like a queen with the upmost respect. Truthfully, I do not like her, but I do try to get along with her to avoid trouble since I visit my nan a lot. \n\nWhat happened was we were out at family lunch the other day, my grandma never leaves the house, not for our family at least, but she has since discovered my nan allows her a glass or two of wine. (She is an alcoholic and almost drank herself to death). So it is well known she only comes out to drink. My grandma tried handing my sister a $100 note, to which my sister declined because she didn’t feel it was fair to the rest of the grandkids at the table. This made her very upset, said she can do what she wants with her own money, and it does not matter. This is where my nan chimed in, and grandma immediately turns to her and starts calling her horrible names and saying she’s stupid and doesn’t know what she’s talking about. \n\nIt’s important to note I am extremely protective of my nan and mum, I will fight with anyone for them at anytime if needed. It was getting heated at the other end of the table, and all I could hear was my grandma belittling my nan and my nan actually beginning to go quiet (she is not easily hurt) so I knew it was bad. I moved to the other end of the table and that seemed to stop my grandma for the time being. Towards the end, my grandma goes to tip the server and nan motions to me that it was to make a point. I laughed and agreed. Grandma turns to me, tells me she can do whatever the f*ck she wants, and I am being extremely rude agreeing with this ret*rd (my nan). This set me off, I told her ‘you know what’s rude? Talking to your own daughter the way you do considering she does absolutely everything for you when you do not deserve it. You’re only out with this family to drink your wine because you can’t control yourself at home’\n\nI admit. It was harsh. She was in disbelief, and did not argue back. My nan did not say anything about it, just told me it’s best not to start with her, but my uncle and mum told me it was plain disrespectful. \n\nI know she’s old, 80, she is extremely healthy and has no mental problems so it’s not like she doesn’t know what she’s saying and doing. She’s absolutely horrible to my nan and constantly talks about loving nans sister, my great aunt, who is a heavy drug addict and does not want to take her in or even visit her whatsoever. I’ve been so fed up with it, my nan finally retired after working her absolute ass off her whole life, and now she has to deal with my grandma instead.

Neither is my wife (55f) nor my three kids (college age and two hs seniors).     \n\nProblem is, we were all raised religious. Wife’s family was super low-effort Xmas and Easter christians; while mine was hard-core, full-send, in church every time the doors were open evangelicals.     \nAnd I was too, up until about 10 years ago when I slowly started to wake up to the hateful, judgy grift that is religion. I’ve just recently started to work through my childhood religious trauma in therapy. I’m carrying a fair share of shame and guilt, but working through it.     \n\nEnter SIL and thanksgiving.     \nApparently, she’s recently become re-invigorated in her faith. Which means when she comes to our home for thanksgiving, christmas, easter or any other holiday meal, she insists on praying before we eat.     \nI do not want to pray anymore. I’ve done prayed enough. I’ve prayed over this and prayed over that and heard prayers be offered my whole life.     \nIn the past with SIL, I’ve simply excused myself from the table during the prayer, but this year I just couldn’t.    \nI guess partly because I really didn’t expect it again this year, I snapped. I said “No. This is our house, this is the meal we prepared, these are our children and our traditions. We don’t believe in god and it’s disingenuous to the point of lying to pretend otherwise. We won’t have a ‘moment of silence’ we won’t ‘meditate on our own idea of what god is’ we will sit and eat the meal. If you’d like to do a “say what you’re thankful for” thing, then fine, but we won’t be praying.    \n\nWell, at least that’s what I intended to say. What actually happened is I was told by my wife to just shut up and leave the table.     \nAfter dinner, we had an argument about why I didn’t just leave the table. I told her why. I told her I’d had enough and needed some autonomy in my own house. I told her if they wanted to pray they could silently. I told her I wish she’d had my back.      \n\nThis is not new information to her. I’ve said this after every family dinner. But, my wife and her sister have a complicated relationship and often wife just defers to sister’s wishes to avoid conflict. This was no different, but this time I needed her to take a stand for myself, for her, and for our family, but instead she just told me I’d ruined the thanksgiving she’d worked so hard on.     \nAnyway, AITA for not just leaving the table during the prayer? Thanks for your time.     \n\nEdit for the folks saying I should’ve said something before: this topic has been brought up beforehand. I have said to all parties involved they’re welcome to pray silently, but we don’t pray at our house before meals. I thought it had been handled, thus my surprise at SIL saying “let’s pray”.     \nAlso, no one in my house is religious. I’m not the only atheist, just the vocal one I guess.

My dad's older brother we'll call Bob is married to his wife we'll call Annie. My dad's older sister we'll call Kate is married to her husband who we'll call Jim. Jim and Kate don't have any kids but Bob and Annie have two girls around my husband's age. Both sets of my Uncles and Aunts have never really been super involved in my life. Jim and Kate have been more for sure, but still with only seeing them like 5 times a year. Bob and Annie on the other hand have been awful most of my childhood and adult life. Bringing peanuts to family functions even though my brother is deathly allergic, making snarky comments to my mom and dad, and an entire lack of speaking to me and my siblings. \n\nMy husband and I have had an unconventional relationship. We met and 6 months later got legally married so we could be with each other when my husband reenlisted into the Army. We know its crazy and people have judged us but we honestly don't care. We are planning to have a real ceremony next year so we can both have that experience since our “Big day” was just signing a paper for 10 minutes. We shared this information with the people we care about most, which is a small circle. So my grandma told a lot of people for the news to get out there. And that's how Bob and Amy found out. My husband and I saw them a couple days later when they were dropping something off to my dad before my dad, husband, and I all went to a baseball game. I got a “hi Katie” and that was it. Didn't acknowledge my new husband or anything. I didn't really care at the moment because this was a normal interaction from them. Later I was angered a bit because there could have been a “hi James” or anything to acknowledge my husband. I was later informed by my mom that Annie had texted my dad and mom in a group chat sending her and Bob's condolences about me getting married. Apologizing that they had to go through this, etc. I was absolutely p*issed. I didn't care if they disagreed but for them to send condolences was in my mind beyond disrespectful. That was the last straw for me to say they aren't invited. I originally was going to, out of respect for my grandma. Now my mom and dad are trying to tell me I'm still inviting them like I don't have a choice. They say it's going to break my grandma's heart more than Annie and Bob.

Tradition is that I host every year. It is and has always been my favorite holiday. She says because my daughter has the sniffles (by no means sick and we even took her to see a doctor to make sure) no one should be “allowed” to attend. So I cooked my usual 16 dishes (everything scratch down to the bread) and no one showed. When I called and asked she compared my daughter to Typhoid Mary (source of past fights) and went into a diatribe about how I’m forcing the divide in the family making them pick between their mother and I. Add in a little guilt from the years I cut off communication entirely about 7 of the last 21 years and you’d have the wonderful evening. \n\nSo I have a ton of food which will go to waste. Because of where I live, donating isn’t an option. I feel like shit because I’ve been abandoned by family, and my kids are wondering why their grandparents didn’t want to see them. \n\nMinor backstory on relationship, I’ve been working on forgiving my parents for my childhood. Not because they deserve to be forgiven for the level of violence experienced but I deserve to not bear the weight of the negative emotions. They’d never admit any type of fault for anything.\n\nSo is turnabout fair play? Do I return the gift and skip or attend her special day and pretend like nothing happened? (Fully expect her to pretend to be the savior of the family for rushing to save the day).\n\n***Update***\nA few of you mentioned giving a lot of the food away to neighbors. This got me thinking who could best use a taste of home. I ended up bringing most to work (I work at an OTR truck yard) and having an impromptu 2nd dinner with some truck drivers stuck at away from their families. Needless to say they appreciated it. \n\nSo conversation had with my mother... I told her we wouldn't be showing up to her birthday tomorrow. She kept asking why I didn't leave my wife and kids at home and go alone to which I defended that we're a package deal. My responsibility is to them above all else. She suggested she send my little brother over to pick up her gift and bring it along if we weren't going. I told her that wasn't going to happen and shot him a text letting him know not to waste the trip. His exactly response was to ask \"she being a bitch again?\". He again apologized for not showing yesterday and made sure to mention needing a knife and gravy to get down that last minute store bought pre-prepped meal. Ok, I'm a little salty there and appreciate him taking the shot to spare my feelings. Thankfully amazon has a nice return policy. Filtering the profanities and guilt, call ended after 3 1/2 mins with me telling her not to call. If Christmas happens I'm tempted to get her a mirror and print out a pamphlet on a certain Greek tale (petty and a bit assholish yes but Christmas is likely off the table now too; it's just a nice thought). My dad's been remarkably silent through this not taking a side. I'm assuming his not taking a side verbally is taking one though inaction. Looks like we'll be going no-contact for a bit. \n\nTo those of you who brought up or DM'd the impression this was having on the kids, thank you. It's a side I never really considered. We don't let them babysit or have sleep overs the way we do with my wife's parents.

I wont go too in depths here but my dad is a wealthy guy, has a good job, ect. But he is unbearable to be around, mad disrespectful to everyone in the household, and generally pretty nasty to interact with at all. Now my sister has an apartment, asks if i want to go to thanks giving at her place, though my parents are not invited. She grew up dealing with the nonsense my dad puts out (basically just verbal, emotional,financial abuse, mostly to my mom). My mom tries to excuse his actions like directly insulting my sister's actions, asking intrusive questions.\n\nAnyways that's not the reason why primarily they were not invited. Around this time i always go out to get some groceries for my sister and mom to cook (I cook a few things but they're far better than i). Though this year has been rough on me financially, but i am still pitching in and offering to get some of the bigger items on the list. My sister asked my dad if he could get thanks giving groceries but he just declined.\n\nNow mind you, this mother fucker eats the most out of everyone, every time during thanks giving. And doesn't even say thank you, or be appreciative. This alone was enough to have my sister just straight up block him and not invite him, my mom too because she was defending his choice to not help at all. Being the stingy dude he is, he only gave my mom 90 bucks to go out and get a whole thanks giving meal for the family. I was going to pitch in but my sister is very much against me doing so. So i decided to just have thanksgiving at her place, not pitch in at all for my parents this, even though my mom is begging me to stay over for it.

Long story short: My friend (18M, referred as E) started dating the girl who my other friend (18M, referred as A) had liked before and had been friends with her since childhood. Now, I'd like to clarify that E only started dating her in April 2025, she had rejected A roughly 6 months before that, meaning that she and A never dated at all, they were just close friends.\n\nThis led to the group breaking apart, with some ups and downs were a comeback was possible, but by September (this happened in April) it became clear that the friend group was no more. This left me and my best friend (18M, referred as P) on a very bad spot, since we weren't involved in any of this but now felt like we had to pick a side. We chose to remain neutral, but I finally broke that neutrality this last month.\n\nIt's worth noting that whilst E had moved on (he was happy with his gf), A clearly hadn't. More often than not, when we hopped on Discord, he would sometimes ramble over and over again about the whole situation. Talking bad about both E and his girlfriend. Me and P tolerated this, since we didn't want to make him mad, but we were clearly getting tired of A's monologues about the situation.\n\nEventually, one of those Discord nights I was done. He was talking about how she had seen one of his friends and told him that her and A were fine, which according to A they weren't. That's when I told that: respectfully A, It's been a year since she rejected you and 6 months since they started dating. You still caring is actually extremely pathetic.\n\nA was extremely surprised, since until now I had just agreed with him on everything he would state (me and P didn't actually agree on everything, but we just didn't want to argue or make him mad). He quickly told me how he has moved on, but he just sometimes feels like yapping about it.\n\nI told him (roughly): No you haven't, I literally don't care about it. You have been saying you've moved on for almost 4 months and yet you still bring it up. Your feelings are meaningless to me at this point, you've said a lot of bad things about both of them, grow up, stop insulting them and stop talking about them. Period.\n\nNow, I'll admit my choice of words was quite harsh, and I would change the way I expressed this. But understand that, from my perspective, it had been 6 months of this happening every 2 or 3 nights on Discord (which we would hop on almost everyday). I got very tired about it.\n\nA and me had an argument which basically ended up in him saying that in his mind I was no longer his friend the same way I was before. He removed me from close friends on Instagram and we barely talk just the 2 of us, it always has to have P on it. Also, according to P, A claims that he can no longer trust me, and that he won't share any personal issues with me.\n\nAITA?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pbfsei/aita_for_outright_invalidating_my_friends_feelings/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pbfsei/aita_for_outright_invalidating_my_friends_feelings/","score":36,"num_comments":42,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764603150.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I have 3 kids (oldest 14 and youngest 5) and they all have a great relationship with my bf. I was single for over 2 years before I met my now bf and always thought to myself if I were to date again it would be best to date someone who has children so they just get it. They would get why I’m not always free, they would get why some days I’m just exhausted, they would just get it’s not just me but that I am a package deal. \n\nMy bf has been mostly understanding of this and I even tell him often, if it’s too much that I get it if he wants out. I expect no man to have to step up as a father figure if they didn’t want too. (I hope that makes sense) my bf has no kids and neither do his siblings so their family events are just the 5 of them always. Him, his twin, younger brother, mom and dad. I however, come from a rather large family so a small family gathering isn’t what I’m used too. My bf always attends my family gatherings and he has finally gotten used to a bigger crowd. \n\nWhen my bf family has their get togethers, my kids and I aren’t invited. This has made me feel as though he is embarrassed of me and what I come with. I often ask when his family can finally meet my boys and he always tells me “they’re all so busy but I’ll ask them again.” It’s been 2 years. To me this is a huge red flag, correct me if I’m wrong.\n\nThanksgiving is tomorrow and he hasn’t brought up anything about the day with his family but he knows what my family is doing since it was discussed in front of him over the weekend at my nieces birthday dinner. So, last night I asked him what the plan was since it’s days away and I wanted to know if we were all going to go so I can bring a dish or something to his family’s since I don’t want to show up empty handed. He said he was going to go there in the day and asked what time my family dinner started. I asked if we were all going and he stared at me. \n\nThis triggered me and told him not to worry about my family holiday (I know it was prolly petty but I was hurt). I asked him if he’s embarrassed of us and he denied it. His family knows me, i have met them several times..but my kids haven’t met them all.\nHe got a little defensive and I told him my feelings. It’s awkward between us and now I’m wondering if he is the one for me..I want someone to be proud and excited of who they are with and things like this make me feel other.

I have two siblings who are also in their 20s, along with one half brother who just turned 10, and I absolutely adore. My dad and half-brother live in a different state, having moved away when I was a teenager, and yes, this has caused some tension between myself and the older siblings and my dad in the past. My dad divorced his second wife (my half brother's mother), and since then has been a little all over the place when it comes to relationships. He had a lot of short-term relationships, and one longer one that when it ended, he kind of went off the rails after. That was at the start of this year. Since then, he went on vacation overseas, and met a woman while he was there. Since then, he's made multiple trips back to see her, and she's come to visit him a few times as well. I've never met her in person, though have talked to her over the phone once. She seems nice enough, but I haven't felt particularly inclined to get to know her - I'm glad that she makes my dad happy, but I also don't see any way that this is going to end happily for those involved. \n\nSo a few months ago, my dad came to my siblings and I and asked if we'd be interested in going on vacation to the country she lives in, with him offering to cover flights and accommodations. I was excited at the idea, especially as I've never gone on a family vacation with my youngest sibling before. \n\nThe problem that's come up is that a few days ago, when I chased him up, he let us know that for just under a week the plan was to stay at her home - with her mother and two other children, in a four-bedroom house. On top of staying with total strangers, it also means sharing a bed with my 20+ year old siblings. I didn't say anything at the time, but was not overly thrilled at the idea. I ended up looking online for other places to stay for my siblings and I in the same town. There are a lot of options around that are well within our own ability to pay for, but as we're there in the new years period, a lot of these places are booking out fast. \n\nI floated the idea with my dad today that if the house was crowded, then we could look for other places to stay. He shut it down hard, saying that he wanted to spend time with us as it's a family vacation, and if we stayed somewhere else then he wouldn't get to see us. I expressed that I wasn't very comfortable staying in a house with people I've never met, and he told me that I could suck it up, and if I didn't like it then I could just not go. \n\nI'm well aware that I'm coming across as ungrateful, but I'm also not comfortable with the idea of staying with a woman whom my dad hasn't even put a label on his relationship with. At the moment, I'm contemplating booking a refundable room nearby while I still can, and bringing it up with my dad and siblings at a later date. \n\nSo, WIBTA for doing so, and AITA for having a problem with it to begin with?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p74k4l/wibta_for_booking_separate_accommodations_on_a/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p74k4l/wibta_for_booking_separate_accommodations_on_a/","score":38,"num_comments":50,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764153548.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I’ve always told my parents (F42, M44) I wanted a big XV party. Like, in our culture, 15th birthdays are huge, basically a wedding-level thing, and they’ve been saving for years.\n\nBut in January, my grandma (68, my mom’s mom) got diagnosed with late-stage cancer. She was super close to me growing up and basically raised me, she used to babysit me every day after school when I was a kid. I realized she might not make it to my XV, and it terrified me.\n\nI asked my parents if we could do a smaller party earlier, like February or March, just a few friends and family so grandma could actually be there. They said no. They told me it was ridiculous to have my XV months before my birthday and that I couldn’t change my mind and say I want a small party because I originally wanted a big party and they’d been saving for it.\n\nOver the year, grandma got worse. I begged multiple times to move the party up. Nothing. She passed in late October. I was a wreck and assumed the party would be canceled. Nope. My parents said grandma would’ve wanted me to celebrate anyway, and now everything’s booked, venue, photographer, flowers, the whole thing.\n\nOn top of that, I overheard my mom arguing with my aunt about how she didn’t help with grandma’s funeral expenses and my mom says it was because of my XV expenses. Honestly, if they’d just done a smaller party in February, some of that money could’ve gone to grandma, and I would’ve understood.\n\nNow I just don’t even want this party. It doesn’t feel like it’s for me anymore. I’m seriously thinking about skipping it. They can’t make me go, right? Like, they can’t force me into the dress and drag me there?

However, the smallest thing can happen and he will turn to absolutely despising me. Mind you this happens every couple of days.\n\nThen on these days he will despise me, he will call me all sorts of names pertaining to being fat. Fat, Pig, greedy, chunky, any sort of character thats on the bigger side, any other name that means being fat, i’ve been called it. I tell my parents this every time and he gets a little ”don’t call names, its not nice” and then 5 minutes later he’ll call me fat again and they will just tell me to ignore him.\n\nMy age is constantly used as an ’i should just ignore him’ or some other sort of age based comment that basically pertains to i‘m an adult now and should just grow up and ignore him. But when you already are insecure about yourself as I definitely aren’t skinny it really does not make you feel nice. My parents know this, and they know i struggle with my mental health so when i’m being called names this much it really effects me.\n\nI constantly say to my parents how it makes me feel shit and how they barely even tell him off and its not fair and i get told to stop trying to parent etc. He calls me all sorts of things and says all sorts of other things to me too on top of this but the most consistent thing is the fat comments. My dad will also often say how its “us both being as bad as each other” because he whips out some comment about how i constantly go in his room and take his stuff off him and do all this stuff.\n\nHowever, since this gets brung up in every argument, i have been knocking on his door before going in for a good 6 months now. This basically just means he lets me in his room so i’m not barging in and we have a mess about, talk, whatever all with him being an active participant in it. But because he whips this out in arguments even when it is factually incorrect they won’t tell him off that much as it ‘not fair’ and then i’ll get shouted at about how its my fault and how i need to grow up. Because once you turn 18 you should be okay with being basically bullied in your own home by a 12 year old right.\n\nWhenever he does even get told off, like today he got his xbox taken away for the first time because he called me a pig for no reason and then a baby after he was told not. He then decides to turn it into a screaming match about favouritism and how i never get told off and whatever. My dad will then still continue to say we’re both as bad as each other when i’ve literally done nothing to warrant this treatment.

I'm currently sick and cannot smell things that well. The source of the smell turned out to be food that Anne had thrown out prior and had gone bad.\n Marie got understandably annoyed at this because she Anne should have taken the trash outside. I agreed with her and thought that she was gonna take out the trash since she said it annoyed her. My mistake for assuming Ig. \n\nOn Thursday I awoke pretty early for me (around 9-10 pm I stay up late I know it's not that early) and rushed to get to practice courses (I basically have to help teach kids). \n\nI got home around 4pm, when Anne usually gets home, and got in bed and slept til 9 and then called a friend. \n\nDuring our call I noticed that Anne was chopping up vegetables like onions and such and opened the window because of how strong the odor was. (Note that she never opens up windows and I usually have to open them up when she cooks). \nShe also threw the vegetable scraps in the trash.\n\nAt around 2 pm the next day I got out of bed and was greeted by the following message (from Marie) in our room's whatsapp gc :\n\n\"You should be ashamed of yourselves. I came home last night and was greeted by this horrible smell only to realize it came from the trash and that there was food inside of it. I pay for this room too and just because I'm gone most of the time doesn't mean I don't expect the room to be clean by the time I come back. You didn't even bother to open a window or anything.\"\n\nI tried telling her that I hadn't noticed the smell, that I didn't use the trash can the day prior and it had been Anne who used it etc. Every attempt was dismissed, and I was told I should've taken out the trash regardless.\n\nI then checked the trash and it was still full. Neither of them had bothered to take it out so I had to.\n\nI've already asked my friends about this and they all agree I'm not the asshole here but they are my friends, and as much as I trust their judgement I know they can't be completely objective.

I know I didn’t say it in the most polite way ever but for context, we both talk and act like this with each other so I didn’t see an issue. I would say he’s the one who goes out of his way to annoy me while I just do my own thing. He then snatched my phone from me and told me to apologise, again thinking he was joking I brushed it off. He locked me in my room and said you can’t come out until you apologise. I was so confused because he’s never acted like this. My dad then unlocked the door and I went to go get my phone from him. Again, he told me I had to apologise but I refused - I know this is stubborn but I didn’t see this as a situation to be apologising over and thought he was overreacting. Of course if I did something way more serious I would have apologised. It just felt like he was trying to parent me and it honestly felt kinda degrading for me to apologise over something so small. \n\nMy parents then were on his side saying I went too far and made him angry, which made me annoyed because if it was roles reversed, I would be getting called too sensitive. Eventually, I had to cave and apologised for being “rude”. \n\nPlease do tell me if I was being rude because I don’t think I was. It really did seem like our playful banter of teasing each other but at the end of it, it just left a weird feeling. \n\nI just want to add further context that my brother does have anger issues and has in the past blown up in my face over something so small as not grabbing a plate for him.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p8zbn6/aita_for_making_my_brother_angry_over_a_regular/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p8zbn6/aita_for_making_my_brother_angry_over_a_regular/","score":27,"num_comments":43,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764347747.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

This was meant to be helping a mate’s mate on my only free day (Sunday).\n\nAbout 2 months ago I agreed to help remove a timber retaining wall and replace it with a concrete sleeper wall. From day one I told him my job comes first and I’m usually only free 1 day a week.\n\nHe only wanted to pay a labour day rate, but I did ~10–15 hours unpaid: planning the wall, working out sleeper/post sizes and concrete, and ordering posts/sleepers to his place. He admitted he had no idea how to do a retaining wall, so I was basically designing and running it.\n\nHe was busy the first 2 weekends, so the start got pushed back ~3 weeks. Then 2 days before we were meant to start he decides he’ll DIY the demolition. He doesn’t actually start pulling the old wall out until the day we were supposed to start the new one, doesn’t finish, and discovers the existing posts are tied into the deck. The spec changes and I have to ring the steel place and change the order.\n\nThen I hear nothing for about 3 weeks. It’s now nearly 2 months since first contact and about 1 month out from Christmas. Nov–Feb is our crazy busy period at work, I’m doing Saturdays and some Sundays and the company trucks are booked on our jobs. I’ve got very little free time and no guaranteed access to trucks for his job.\n\nWhen he finally gets back to me I tell him I’m not comfortable anymore – the deck/post situation has made it more complex and it feels out of my experience for something I’m doing basically solo on Sundays.\n\nHe rings asking if I can do it that coming weekend. I say no, I’m working Saturday and already have plans Sunday, and repeat that I’m not confident. The next morning he texts saying my coworker is coming that afternoon so we can START on the weekend… even though I’d just said I’m not free.\n\nAt that point I’d done a heap of unpaid planning and waited through his delays for nearly 2 months. Him ignoring my availability was the last straw. I text (politely) that I can’t do the wall anymore, or at least not until March when work slows down. I still offer to help order the posts correctly and give him my plan so he can DIY or hand it to another tradie.\n\nHe replies that I accepted a job and “pulled out halfway through”, says it’s shit of me, and finishes with “fuck off mate”.\n\nMy boss knows the whole story, needs me for our jobs, and is 100% on my side. I genuinely don’t have time or trucks right now. Maybe I could’ve said earlier, “If the job gets delayed or the specs change, I might not be available anymore,” but that’s about it.\n\nI’m pretty anxious and a people-pleaser so my brain keeps telling me I’ve let him down, which is why I’m posting.

Last night, I had just bought Taco Bell for dinner. I got home and ate most of what I had bought, my grandfather came into the kitchen where my mom and I were. I saw him looking through the pantry for something to eat and I knew he liked Taco Bell so I offered him a taco. He took it and thanked me. A small detail, my grandfather often eats out and buys food to bring home for everyone to share. He loves Wendy's and fast food in general.\n\nAnyway, I told him I couldn't eat anymore since I was full. He then commented that I should stop eating (I think he meant to say buying food) because I was getting quite fat. I couldn't believe he just said that to me. There is nothing wrong with being overweight, but I just couldn't believe he felt so comfortable commenting on my body and telling me what to do with it. I try my best to eat healthy and I'm actually not overweight, in fact, I go to the gym often. I didn't know why he said that, seeing as I have actually been loosing weight and gaining muscle, but it still upset me. I didn't know what to say. My mom hates when I am visibly upset and defend myself from family members, too so my mind was blank.\n\nI left the room but then came back and said, \"You don't deserve to eat that taco.\" He snapped back, \"Come take it back then!\" I ignored him and started walking upstairs. I heard my mom calmly say, \"Why would you tell her she's fat?\" Like, really mom? Now you say something? I got to my room and remembered: \\*Whenever I'm upset I like to go on a short drive\\*. I grabbed my coat and purse, went downstairs, saw they left and my grandma was in the kitchen, I told her I would be back soon.\n\nOnce I got in the car I decided to not go on a drive, I was going to the grocery store parking lot around the corner and chill in the car. I watched some TikTok's and before I knew it, I felt a LOUD knock at my passenger window. It was my mom. She was furious. I rolled down the window and she started screaming, \"Are you an Idiot? Are you stupid?\" I asked her what was wrong.She asked me why I was in that parking lot for 3 HOURS. I said I didn't even realize I was there for 3 hours! She was sleeping and my little sister woke her up to ask where I was. She told me to drive home because she was going to be driving right behind me, and that she was going to take my \"f\\\\\\*\\\\\\*\\\\\\*ing car\" away. (My car was a Christmas gift to me, but my parents have full control over where I can take it, for a gift it sure has a lot of limits)\n\nOnce home, she asked me for me keys and \"what is wrong with you? Why were you there? I told her that I didn't want to be in the house because I didn't want my grandfather to say anymore insults to me. (Now that I think about it, I think I like going out because when I'm in the house, I feel like it's a constant reminder of the bad experience I just had). She asked me if I would take off to the streets every time someone said something to me. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: Thank you for your honest responses everyone, yes I want to move out so I am saving up for that. there's been many situations where I've gotten yelled at and then been told I was acting like a victim so I am going to get out of this house. I also apologize for the lack of paragraphs, I wrote this at 5am because I couldn't sleep and forgot that it's difficult to read a huge blob.

We are also expecting our first child shortly after, according to friends the process to acknowledge a child is quite difficult for same sex couples when not married and this is why we marry earlier than planned.\n\nWe wanted to keep it as simple as possible and opted for a simple wedding at the municipal office, and want to give a celebration in about 1,5-2 years once we've had more time to plan and save money. This type of marriage allows 8 guests, so some people (sisters husbands, children and stepmom) won't be able to attend the signing. Theres no ceremony and the official part takes 5-10 minutes, this was communicated. Obviously we would've liked everyone to be there, but we chose to do it this way. We plan to take family to lunch nearby and go for a walk, and invite our friends over for dinner to celebrate. These celebrations are more important to us than the 5 minutes of signing. I'll be open about the fact that there could have been an option of a slightly bigger marriage (40 people) and would allow for a ceremony, however this would cost 800-1300 euros extra and we just wanted to keep it small and not break the bank yet. \n\nThe issue is, not everyone seems to feel this way. Me and my fiancée both asked our two siblings as witnesses before the date/location was locked, even though I've always had a rocky relationship with my sister Isabelle (34F). \n\nIsabelle called me last week and asked why we were getting married on the chosen date, that we could just acknowledge our child without marriage and marry later. I told her that we've heard that it's a bit more complicated in our case according to our same sex friends with children, and that it's our marriage and we want to get married on our anniversary. She expressed that her oldest daughter, Olivia (6F), really wanted to attend as she really likes weddings. I honestly love Olivia, and I would love to have her there. I told Isabelle that on the day itself it would most likely be allowed to let one extra person join the signing so Olivia could probably join, and that we could also record the signing or even FaceTime at that moment. We left it at that and Isabelle didn't seem too upset. \n\nIsabelle called me again today and expressed that she thought we were only thinking of ourselves and not about the feelings of the others, she gave me these options: Just having the witnesses attend(no parents), get the bigger location so everyone can attend, or she and her family won't be attending at all\n\nI told Isabelle that I was sorry that they felt this way, but that I didn't think she had a right to demand these things about our marriage. The call ended with Isabelle notifying me that she and her family will not be attending. \n\nSo, AITA for planning a wedding at which only our siblings and parents will be able to attend the 5-10 minutes signing while the rest will have to wait and join us afterwards to celebrate?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p763ul/aita_for_only_having_parents_and_siblings_at_our/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p763ul/aita_for_only_having_parents_and_siblings_at_our/","score":26,"num_comments":57,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764158966.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I’m 28F, the 4th of her 6 kids. She had no will, no money, and no arrangements. She had been living with my oldest brother “Tom” (36M).\n\nWhile we were all in the ER (except two siblings who live out of state), Tom said he would “cover everything.” His girlfriend is the one who financially supports him, so she essentially would be the one paying. I offered to split the cost because in opinion that isn't fair.\n\n The hospital told us we had 24 to 48 hours to decide where to send her. Over the next two days, I found the cremation place, contacted them, arranged everything, set up a GoFundMe, and my husband even pulled from his 401k because we live paycheck to paycheck and didn’t know if Tom would follow through. The total was over $2k, so that's a huge deal for us. A few days ago the funeral home requested payment, so I paid it. Afterwards I called Tom for his half, and he told me he’d “get back to me.” Hours later I called again and he blew me off. He hasn’t responded since. I’m not shocked, but it still hurts. Then there’s my oldest sister “Christina” (42F). She’s financially stable, but her son (23M) recently got arrested and she’s been paying his lawyer fees. I intentionally didn’t ask her to contribute because I didn’t want to add to her stress. During Thanksgiving, when people were talking about how much she’s been helping her son, someone joked that you’d think he’d at least be appreciative since she chose to help him instead of helping with our mom’s cremation. Christina laughed and said, “I’ve given that b\\*\\*\\*\\* enough over the years, she’s not getting a single thing out of me anymore.”\n\nBack to the main subject. Both Tom and Christina expect “their” share of our mom’s ashes. But neither of them helped call funeral homes, make arrangements, pay for the costs, or even helped share the GoFundMe. I feel incredibly hurt. I feel like as older siblings they should’ve stepped up, yet my husband and I ended up doing everything. So… AITA for not wanting to share the ashes with them?\n\n This is my first time posting so please be kind. I can provide more context if needed. \n\n***Context***\n1. My mom lived with my brother for about 2-3weeks, in a drug house. She paid her part by doing DoorDash, etc. He in turn, stole and pawned her things. This was not his home, it was a home of 7+ people. \n2. My mom and sister lived together 15 years ago, my mom paid her part and they would constantly fight often so my mom eventually moved out. They're both toxic people, so they just never had a good relationship. \n3. My younger siblings and I were mainly her other sources of income when she needed it. My mom was the type of person to use you as much as she could and discard you. So we would help in ways, you'd help a homeless person. Buy them food, provide them a night in a hotel, or fill their gas tank, but never hand them money. She was a drug addict so there isn't a safe way to go about it.\n4. The GoFundMe didn't raise what it needed to, so my husband and I covered the rest. There was no double dipping and that would be senseless anyways since they can literally see how much it raised anyways and they also have a copy of how much the cremation cost. \n5. Thank you all for bringing fresh inputs. Even if it's not what I want to hear, you're all saying things I need to hear. I appreciate your words, and clear thoughts. That's what I came here for and again thank you for being a great community. \n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pbo4bg/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_moms_ashes_with/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1pbo4bg/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_moms_ashes_with/","score":26,"num_comments":139,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764621511.0,"edited":1764629470.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Some flaws she has told me about that I have been improving/fixing are being dry (not too energetic and emotional) often, following schedules too strictly -- basically over-planning and having a stick up by butt lol. We are both U.S. citizens in the USA, we both have international backgrounds (a mix of central European and South American countries) in our family lineage, we both speak another language, and almost everyone in our family holds multiple citizenships and has a multicultural background. \n\nA central European and US background makes for someone very punctual and a South American background does not, so I have planned dates without reservations, planned in an extra 45min-1.5hr when hanging with her family, and done all my work/organization on days her family is not around so I won't miss any deadlines. Those are my changes to her feedback. \n\nOne thing I have not really noticed anywhere I have visited, nor with anyone I have met, is an acceptance of chewing with your mouth open and talking with your mouth full. I was raised on it and everyone else I know is the same too.\n\nOver the time I've known her, I've always insisted on never doing either of those two things. It has resulted in what I perceive to be normal pauses in conversation and not being gross, and what she perceives to be annoyingly long periods of silence when the conversation should be flowing. I have been hoping for a year that: she would notice I emphasize not chewing/talking like that and decide to stop, notice how basically everyone around us does what I do and stop, notice how I have also chided children for doing that and told them things like \"Alice, I can't understand you. Remember not to talk with a mouth full of food\" and stop, and notice in movies like *She's the Man* that it's well-known to be a bad thing. \n\nSo, a week ago I told her for the first time verbally to please not do it. She did not stop, ignored me as being extra, told me \"leave me alone,\" but we agreed it would be something we would raise our future kids to not do. She possibly called her mother about it (one of the few times she called her mom and wouldn't tell me why even though I walked in as they finished talking about when her mom said \"el es un buen muchacho\"). \n\nAfter a week, I decided to let her know that my folks awkwardly/quietly mentioned it to me -- I was shocked they felt strongly enough to tell me. After she mentioned she would tell me if her family said something bad about me, I decided I'd do the same and broke my folks' privacy to let her know what they said. She is so angry she called them/me rude and left the house.

We both happy with 50/50 atm.\n\nNow after living here for a while, and she’s heading back to China for holidays and ain’t to happy to pay $400 AUD/ week for for a room she won’t be using for a while, so says the rent is too expensive for her. She wants to either:\n\t1.\trent out the parking spot to someone else to reduce our rent, or\n\t2.\tmake me pay extra rent each week because I have the master + use the parking.\n\nI’m not comfortable renting the spot bc I actually need it, and I don’t feel it’s fair to change the rent split after she already agreed to it and moved in. But we’ve been friends for years and I don’t want to ruin our relationship.\n\nAITA for saying no to both options? What would be a fair way to handle this?\n\nEDIT: Our bedrooms are actually the same size, and she also has her own bathroom, so the ‘master’ really only refers to the layout, not extra space. When we viewed the place, she specifically said she didn’t care about having an ensuite and was happy with the even split. That’s why I felt it wasn’t unfair at the time, since we agreed on it together. I also wouldn’t have taken the room or signed the lease this way if she wasn’t comfortable with it. I’m happy to pay extra for parking, but my own finances matter too. I’m honestly not sure what the fairest approach is here, so that’s why I’m asking\n\nMORE INFO: The parking spot comes with the apartment, and choosing a place without a parking spot wouldn’t have reduced the rent\n\n**FINAL EDIT PLS READ**: I didn’t expect this many replies! Thank you all so much for taking the time to respond. **I’ve decided that I’m going to pay a bit extra for the parking spot.**\nOn the floor plan, all of our facilities are the same, the only difference is the layout. My bathroom happens to be inside my room, which is why it’s labeled the ‘master.’ We rarely have guests, so she has always been comfortable with her room and never felt like she was missing anything.\n\n**Neither of us is under major financial pressure(her family is ridiculous rich, her monthly is about $6500 AUD, and I work as apprentice mechanic, earned $3600),** but this is my first time renting so there are a lot of things I’m still learning. I care about my friend deeply and I don’t want her to feel upset. I’m usually very generous with her too.  \n**I don’t even use the living room, she keeps all her things there to the point that I don’t really have space to eat. I also clean up for her a lot without ever complaining. I gave her a lot of rides and do a lot of shopping. She can be a bit bossy sometimes and occasionally crosses my boundaries (I won’t get into the details here), so maybe that’s why I’ve become overly sensitive about some things. I’m trying to figure out how things generally work.**\n\nShe wasn't unwilling to pay rent while she was away; **it was just that the thought of still having to pay rent during her absence made her come up with this solution to reduce her own rent.**\n\nAlso, English isn’t my first language, so maybe my phrasing caused some misunderstandings. I’ll try to express myself more clearly :)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p79mpc/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_more_rent_or_rent_out/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p79mpc/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_more_rent_or_rent_out/","score":23,"num_comments":97,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764168575.0,"edited":1764175582.0,"link_flair_text":"Asshole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Normally I spend Thanksgiving with my family, but because my sister is sensitive to being around alcohol, I didn’t immediately ask if they could/wanted to come.\n\nA few days later, my dad asked if he and my sister could come. I told him I’d ask my gf but warned them there would be alcohol and it might not be the best environment for my sister. He said it shouldn’t be a problem, because they could drive separate and leave early if it was too much. My gf shared the same concerns, but she still checked with her relatives and got the okay after her and I talked about it. I relayed everything to my dad, and he seemed excited. He even planned to bring desserts and appetizers for everyone.\n\nLater, my gf found out the gathering would be a lot smaller than last year and probably less hectic/less alcohol, so I relayed that to my family. My dad and sister said that made them more comfortable and were still excited to join.\n\nTwo days later (11/19), I came home from work and shared my excitement for the event. My dad proceeded to tell me he and my sister were going to a family friend’s Thanksgiving instead, saying he “forgot to tell me“ and smirked. I was speechless and crushed. I ended up going for a drive to cool off because I really didn’t know what to say to him. I texted my sister how I felt about what our dad said. She replied that she didn’t feel comfortable around alcohol and that our dad made the decision two days earlier… the same day I told him it would be a small gathering.\n\nI didn’t talk to them for a couple days bc I was pissed. I invited my gf to hangout (11/21) and we were talking downstairs about work, finances, plans to live on our own, and a little about Thanksgiving. Then out of nowhere, my dad stormed downstairs and started yelling that I was “talking shit” about him and my sister. Our conversation had nothing to do with them. The yelling and accusations continued, and I asked to go outside because I didn’t appreciate all the yelling in front of my gf. For context, my dad is usually very calm and this was the angriest I’d ever seen him. When I asked what I supposedly said, he couldn’t name anything and eventually admitted I was right about what transpired. \n\nWe talked it through the next day, and I explained my issue wasn’t them choosing another Thanksgiving, but the lack of communication and agreeing to plans they didn’t intend to keep. \n\nI also told my dad that he owed my gf an apology for yelling in front of her and for cancelling on us when her family was nice enough to include mine for Thanksgiving.\n\nNow, today (11/25), my dad texted me asking if he’s “re-invited” to my gf’s family Thanksgiving.

But well this place has 5 rooms but they aren't in very good conditions, thats why this place was so cheap but i didn't mind cleaning this place up with help when we got here and buying a couple stuff we needed. \n\nThe issue comes when suddently a girl came yesterday without telling us, the landlord told us that a girl left a couple of months ago to live in another city and she left most of the place broken and with food decomposing all over the place. Also she didn't pay rent most of the time. But well she suddently shows up yesterday and tells us that she is gonna stay here from now on. \n\nWe were all pissed but thats that, okay so suddently my roomate told me that what if she tells her ex to come to the city and stay at the last room avilable (thats basically destroyed btw) because he had a fight with his parents and wants to move out from his house into here. The thing is that i basically don't know anything of this guy and she has been telling me that he wasn't a good boyfriend and all that. But all of a sudden yesterday she tells me that he is clean and doesn't make noise and that it's fine since she knows him. I told her that i don't care if it's someone she knows or a random person but that i'm kinda opposed to it because i just don't want to have less space here.

She didn't give  me any concrete plan but I agreed.  \nLater in the afternoon I found myself tired from the hectic shopping mall, but I eventually decided to go to the vinyl market and pick up my girlfriend after. I called her to arrange our plans. She had no plan so I suggest a café she wanted to visit the day before.

I know she really wanted to go out, so I asked her \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah I'm sure, it's fine.\" So we hung up and I started gathering my things to go out again. \n\nMinutes later she sent me a message saying how she was confused why I'd call to make plans just to tell her I'm tired. I apologized and told her I did not mean anything by it. It was entirely off-handed. At that point it did not seem fair to go to the vinyl market, so I cancelled that and insisted we see each other. If I had energy to go to that market, I had energy to see my partner. She shut me off. I insisted because she was clearly upset, but she turned me down.\n\nMuch later in the evening she blew up my messages, very angry at me.

I am a very family-motivated and sensitive individual, and my brother is autistic and self identifies as a \"high functioning sociopath\" (yes like the line from BBC Sherlock.) After my brother came out as trans, and around the third time he broke off an engagement with some poor dude, he started to drift away from the family; which was fairly notable since we're a very tight-knit bunch. But it's been significantly more apparent since the rest of our family moved to Canada and he stayed in the USA.\n\nNow, this year is not the first Christmas since he came out as trans, and since he's gone back to school for the third time, and has since decided he's going to be a neurosurgeon, my mother is still giving him i think about a 1k/mo stipend. Meanwhile me, my twin and my other brother (all younger than him) are full working adults. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that this *is* the first year after my parents sold it that we aren't celebrating in my childhood home, and in fact, in an entirely different country (ik USA to Canada is not crazy far, but still).\n\nCut to a few days ago, where my mother informs me that my brother (25M) might be coming for Christmas, and that she'd offered to pay for his flight over for it. (He doesn't have a car.) And while I'd honestly rather him not have him for Christmas at all, I understand that my parents still want to see him, and that this may very well be the holiday that is indicates if he spends any holidays with us going forward. (Or talks to us at all outside of needing things.)\n\nNow, this year I am getting several very intricate gifts for my family, including a photo-display for my parents of their wedding photos (recently recovered from the depths of their attic as we were clearing out my childhood home for sale), a painting I'm doing of my grandfather and his late wife, a set of earrings i snuck off to buy for my mother when we took a trip together to Paris this year, etc. Just a lot of very sappy stuff I've spent the whole year planning - with several gifts per person, for the most part.\n\nAnd this has led me to where I am now. At this point, I haven't spoken to my brother for the better part of a year, and the only person he contacts in the family is my mother... So needless to say, i have absolutely no idea what i would get him. (My best guess would be something japanese, since he likes that type of thing.) But honestly, the more i've thought about it, I don't really *want* to get him anything.

First time poster but long time lurker.\nI (17M) have had a car for about 5 months, and tbh, I LOVE it. Not just the car, but the freedom of having one. Recently, my sister (19F) has gotten her drivers license, and with that, my parents are saying that we should share the car; and sure, that seems fair. But my problem is that I was told she doesn’t have to pay me back for any components I put in (ie. tablet, SD card for dash cam [this was forced]). There are some other things I’ve done to the car like new a new stereo because the factory one didn’t have an aux or Bluetooth, and the speakers in the car, but those are my decisions that were not necessary and that can’t be removed from the car. My view on her using this car is that she will use the tablet and dash cam that I was forced to buy. To me this doesn’t seem fair because I paid fully for them, if she was just borrowing the car until my parents buy her a new car, that’s completely fine, but I’m under the impression that this will be a shared car. I know that it seems childish to complain about this, but since I got winter tires (which my parents said she has to pay half for), I’ve had no money, and her using and taking advantage of the tablet that I paid for in full just doesn’t seem to be fair. I will take 100% fault if I’m deemed TA, but I was just wondering if there’s any validity to my opinion.\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit - UPDATE:\nHey everyone, I know this post didn’t gain too much traction, but I would like to say thank you to all the people who called me out for being the AH, and for others for understanding my POV, but still called me out. Many comments were pretty confused and asked questions or said there was not enough info to make a reasonable decision, so I’ll clear it all up here.\n1. Many people were asking if my parents forced me to buy the tablet and dash cam; the dash cam I was, but tablet was my decision. The 1st dash cam I got was just a camera, and it took the cigarette lighter port (CLP), then I got a car tablet because my father said my phone holder was blocking some of my view whilst driving, which is understandable. The tablet came with its own camera, which was better quality, and I was able to navigate the recordings a lot easier. The tablet also took CLP, so instead of buy a double CLP plug-in for $40, I got an SD card at the same price because the double CLP would hit my knee (past experience).\n2. The car is in my name, but my parents bought it. I have paid for the insurance for 5 months and any oil changes, upgrades, flat tires, etc.\n3. I talked to my parents, and they said this is essentially my car, but will be sharing it until my sister wants her own car. They said she doesn’t have to pay me back for anything done in the past, (which I now agree with after seeing everyone’s responses and points) but she will pay half for the tires. The only thing I don’t really agree with that they decided is that  if in the spring, my sis decides to get a car, I would also have to split the tire payment with her, which to me doesn’t make too much sense, because I won’t be driving her car, but I digress.\n4. Any fixes the car needs from now on, will be split evenly between me and my sister (As long as she drives the car).\n\nSo I think that’s most of the questions that were asked in the comments. If there are any more questions, please feel free to ask.\nSo what’s going to happen from here on out? Any drama, did we get in a fight? Did I get kicked out?! Fortunately not; I know how much Redditers love drama, but this is kind of a boring, but happy end to the story. We will split everything going forward, if one of us wants an upgrade, but the other doesn’t, we will just have to suck it up, or pay for it ourselves. I apologized to my sister for asking for money, it wasn’t fair to her because she had no say into what I put into it beforehand, and if she decides to use any of it, it’s her right. I guess the thought of me getting money (even as little as $50) just controlled my broke mind, lol (jk). But that’s all, we are back to normal. Once again, any questions or even more advice for the future, is welcome and greatly appreciated.

It was something that her and I would bicker over (as siblings do) about who was allowed to set what up. It was one of my favourite things about that holidays to set this Christmas village up. \nNow that I’m an adult living with my boyfriend (26M) we have gotten our own Christmas village over the last 5 years that we set up together. My boyfriend also had a village growing up so he cherishes the village as well. The village that we have currently is an assortment of pieces that were either given to us or bought from others etc. \n\n\nNow on to the main story.

My mom’s had a rough few years medically, multiple major surgeries, cancer scares, organ removals (uterus, pancreas, etc.). My brother lives with her and takes care of her day to day.\n\nYesterday (Sunday), apparently they had to take her to the ER. I didn’t find out until *today* (Monday) when my mom texted me saying she’d been in the hospital.\n\nNaturally, I asked what happened, and she told me they thought she was having a *stroke.* My heart dropped. I started asking a bunch of questions, and she said thankfully it wasn’t a stroke,  it was Bell’s Palsy. They treated her quickly and sent her home with antibiotics and muscle relaxers. I was relieved.\n\nThen she said, “We decided not to call you because it was late and we didn’t want to stress you out.”\n\nThat honestly made me mad. I told her, “If you think you’re having a stroke, that’s a good reason to call me.” I told her I was upset that she and my brother didn’t tell me, but I was glad she was okay. I tried to let it go for the moment.\n\nBut as the day went on, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. If it *had* been a stroke, she could’ve died,  and I wouldn’t have even known until after the fact. The thought of missing that chance to be there for her, or to say goodbye, really got to me.\n\nSo I texted my brother, like:  \n**Me:** “What the heck, man? Mom could potentially be having a stroke and you guys don’t call me?!”  \n**Him:** “They literally saw her in less than an hour and confirmed she didn’t have one. It was late. If it was serious, I would’ve called.”  \n**Me:** “It was a *possible* stroke!”  \n**Him:** “That’s why I took her right away. And they confirmed it wasn’t. In less than an hour.”\n\nWe argued. I admit I said some mean things,  like that he’s not mature and that any adult would think to notify another loved one. He said I was making it all about myself.\n\nNow I’m wondering if I overreacted. I *am* grateful she’s okay, but I still feel angry that no one thought to call me during what could’ve been a life-threatening emergency.\n\nSo… AITA for getting mad that they didn’t tell me?\n\n**TL;DR:** My mom thought she was having a stroke and went to the hospital. My brother didn’t tell me until the next day because it turned out to be Bell’s Palsy. I got mad they didn’t call me, he says I’m making it about myself. AITA?\n\n  \n**UPDATE for Context:**\n\nA few people assumed my brother lives with my mom as her caregiver. That’s not actually the case. They’ve lived together for years because it’s financially easier for both of them. He was physically present with her and he absolutely stepped up in the moment, I’m grateful for that and I told him so.\n\nEven though I don’t live in the house, I’m still involved in her care in a different way. My mom is primarily Spanish-speaking, and I’m the one she relies on to translate test results, scans, medical letters, financial documents, anything complicated. My brother doesn’t handle that part because he gets flustered and is scared of making a mistake, so she usually comes to me for understanding. That’s been the case since we first came to this country (when I was 13).\n\nWhat’s frustrating for me is the inconsistency. She comes to me for every medical letter, every test result, every question about diagnoses, but then something that could have been life-ending happens and I’m completely excluded. It puts me in a weird place emotionally. It feels like I’m “in” when it’s convenient and “out” when it actually matters.\n\nI also fully understand why they wanted to spare me the stress. My own health hasn’t been great lately, and with my son on the autism spectrum, they know I already have a lot on my plate. I don’t blame them for wanting to protect me, the intention wasn’t bad.\n\nBut this is one of the few things I want on my plate. If something truly serious ever happened to either of my parents, I would want the chance to say goodbye or to be present. That’s the root of why I reacted so strongly.

She's already graduated college, and I'm set to graduate in May (which is also when our lease ends.) We've lived together for a year and a half. We do argue sometimes, but we've always been able to communicate and get through fights\n\nI have not enjoyed apartment life. I also don't have a space to live with either of my parents, so it's the closest thing I have to a permanent home. I pay for my half of rent/groceries myself, with no help from parents. My roommate has a space at both her parents' houses and they give her a lot of money\n\nWe both enjoy gaming, but I have my setup in my bedroom whereas hers is just her TV in the living room. Ergo, she's out there basically all the time. My space is ok for now, but I'd rather have a setup outside my room so it's not so cramped. I also don't feel comfortable using her TV in the living room unless I'm with her or when she's out\n\nAs we're looking at places to move, I told her that I want a place that has more space so I can have a gaming setup outside my room. I think it'd be more efficient for both of us if we each had a space. She said we could share the living room and I could connect my stuff too, but I don't like that idea because I want the freedom to play games as long as I want without impeding on her gaming/TV time. Also, given how much time she spends out there already, I think sharing a gaming space would be even worse than a cramped room setup\n\nI've browsed Zillow and Trulia, and I've found a few places that would have that space and falls in our price range. Not all the options have that, though, and they constantly pop up and leave\n\nShe said she's ok with looking for places with that extra space, but there's no guarantee. I told her that it's really important to me, and I would rather live by myself if we can't find a place that has it\n\nThen she got mad at me for not compromising, and which turned into a lecture about me being an only-child who needs to learn to share\n\nAnother friend I talked to said that I should just agree to find a compromise and talk to her about how we'd divide time in the living room.

We broke up around six months ago. It wasn’t messy honestly, we just realized we weren’t compatible romantically. We agreed to stay friends, and for the most part, we’ve been pretty good at that.\nHere’s where it gets complicated.\nEvan has always been a “helper” type. \nWhen we were dating, he’d fix things at my apartment, drive me to appointments, carry heavy stuff, etc. After the breakup, he kept doing these things. At first it was comforting like, “Oh, we’re mature exes who can still rely on each other.”\nBut recently, it’s been a lot.\nHe’ll show up at my place with groceries because he “was already at the store.” He’ll text me that he’s in my neighborhood and “can take care of that squeaky door hinge.” When my car battery died, he came over at 11 PM to jump it even though I told him AAA was already on the way.\nI didn’t ask him to stop, because he seemed genuinely happy to help and I didn’t want to assume weird intentions.\nBut last week, his new girlfriend messaged me. Very politely. She asked if I could “establish some clearer boundaries” with Evan because she’s uncomfortable with how involved he still is in my life. She said it feels like she’s competing with a ghost of our past relationship.\nI apologized and said I’d talk to him.\nWhen I did, he got really upset. He said he knows the breakup was his fault (it honestly wasn’t we just drifted) and helping me is “the least he can do.” He also said I’m one of the only people he feels genuinely needed by. That part made me feel awful.\nI told him I appreciated everything he’s done, but I don’t want to be the reason his new relationship struggles. I said maybe he should focus on his girlfriend more and not worry about fixing every problem I have.\nHe got quiet and said, “So you don’t want me in your life at all?”\nI said no, that’s not what I meant we can still be friends, just not whatever this is.\nSince then, he’s been distant and cold. Mutual friends think I blindsided him and that if his girlfriend has issues, that’s “her insecurity, not my problem.” Others say it is inappropriate for an ex to still be doing boyfriend-level things.\nNow I’m wondering if I overstepped. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I definitely didn’t want to get involved in his new relationship.

But when it was time for bed (around 10 p.m.), things shifted. I asked my brother to turn off the lights in our room. For context, we live in a small house with no spare bedroom, so my brother and I share a room.\n\nHe was studying and said he needed the lights on. So I asked him to study in the living room instead, reminding him that this exact situation happened a week ago: I wanted to study while he wanted to sleep, so I went to the living room to study while he slept. I expected him to do the same now.\n\nBut he refused and said he couldn’t focus in the living room. Any other night, I might have just given in or even gone to sleep on the couch. But today I was exhausted. Our parents heard the commotion and intervened, but I was so tired that I kept insisting, and he kept refusing. After some back and forth, I finally pleaded with him, telling him I was extremely tired and genuinely couldn’t sleep either on the couch or with the lights on.\n\nHe eventually turned off the main lights but switched on a small bulb in the corner, on **my** side, and the glare went straight into my eyes. That clearly wasn’t going to work. I reminded him again of our original arrangement, but he still didn’t adjust. I got frustrated, pulled my blankets off the bed, and left the room. Then my parents reprimanded him, and suddenly he said, “Well then, ask her to come back and sleep. I’ll turn off the lights now.”\n\nSo when my mum came to tell me to go back to the room since he’d “done what I wanted,” I refused.  \n\nBut at that point, it wasn’t just about the lights anymore. It was about the principle: he wasn’t willing to do for me what I’ve already done for him. It showed me he doesn’t value my comfort, my peace, or my time the way I value his. Oh, and it's not some silly sibling thing. I have adjusted multiple times for him, a couple of examples being: His face gets sweaty even in winter, so the AC stays on, even if we are both shivering, because he can't sleep with a sweaty face. 2. When he comes back from school, he uses the desk while l get up and sit on the bed until he is done, then I can get it back. (Please don't suggest getting separate rooms; that just isn't financially possible for my family)\n\nThen both she and my brother started telling me I was the difficult one who never backs down and drags out the fight unnecessarily, but why would I? I hardly ever ask for anything, and the one time I do, he doesn’t even bother.\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p9vran/aita_if_i_refuse_to_sleep_in_the_same_room_after/","permalink":"/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1p9vran/aita_if_i_refuse_to_sleep_in_the_same_room_after/","score":15,"num_comments":17,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764440253.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Not the A-hole","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

To keep it short we both raise service dogs on campus. They are from different organizations but we live together in a suite style dorm dogs have no contact though. Ever since i got my dog our friendship has been strained mostly due to her trying to direct everything i do with him. At first I appreciated the help her current dog is her second and mines my first, but it became more her taking over my training and telling me my dog was bad. He’s 5 months has some behavioral issues that are very puppy like (mouthing, barking etc) her dog is very similar (also 5 mon). She’s talked down to me before about stuff ive always seen it as an insecurity she has where she’s gotta feel better for some reason. Mostly school related if i get a worse grade shell lecture me about how hard she studied and if i do better she‘ll be passive aggressive about it for a bit. Her organization recently did a puppy swap where essentially she got another raisers dog for a week and this dog was kind of a disaster case. i know he was definitely stressing her out but everything suddenly became my dogs fault whenever that dog was having an issue. Normally im fine with her putting me down to feel better im at a point in my life where i honestly dont take in any negative feelings towards me, and I’ve always been able to rationalize it as just an insecurity. \n\nhowever this time was different. I think it’s because it’s about my dog. Shes a perfectionist and shes constantly saying she can fix any ”bad” dog. she couldn’t fix this puppy swap dog at least not easily and so instead of her not being the best it was my dog messing up that dog. I kept this to myself until she directly blamed my dog again for her puppy swaps dogs behavior. Essentially i asked if walking together to class would be too much on the dog due to mine, i knew he was dog distracted so essentially i was asking if we should space it out. she responded “yeah probably because he hates (my dog), due to how bad he’s been acting” Im assuming her biggest issue was when my dog ran up and down in front of her dorm room door causing her dog to freak out. I was walking him and had tripped sprained my ankle and ended up dropping his leash. since i was crying he kind of freaked out and ran around like a crazy man for a couple seconds until i composed myself. I apologized for this since it was late and my dog shouldn’t have acted like that, but clearly that was still a thing. I ended up getting upset with her after that comment and telling her that just because she was so goddam insecure about not being able to stop that dog from loosing its mind constantly didn’t mean my dog was the problem. She got mad about that which lead into an argument. I feel like i was an asshole for snapping like that, but im also kind of sick of the comments so AITA?

{"id":"1p7lz0b","name":"t3_1p7lz0b","subreddit":"AmItheAsshole","author":"CommentMiserable1856","title":"AITA Because i want to go away for university?","selftext":"This is a brand new account because I want to stay anonymous.\n\nSo, I (19M) am finishing middle school next year (in my country the school system is different, so after this step I go to university). I’m choosing between two universities, and I need to know if I’m the asshole here.\n\nFirst university is in my town. Honestly, it’s pretty bad. The building is falling apart, the teachers aren’t great, people say they don’t really teach much, and there’s basically zero social life. I’ve never heard anyone call it a good choice.\n\nSecond is university about an hour away. Most of my friends go there. They say it’s challenging but fun, the social life is good, and they learn a lot. I visited it recently and I really liked it. The buildings are renovated, and the dorms are brand new\n\nSo after thinking it through, I told my parents that I prefer the second university. My mom fully supports me she just wants me to choose what’s best for me. My dad, however was immediately against it. At first he said he wasn’t sure, but recently he told me not to even think about it. For context, my dad runs a small company. Sometimes I help with the most boring, unpleasant tasks, which I don’t mind, but it’s not like the business depends on me. He claims I need to stay to “help out” and “learn,” even though nothing he does is related to engineering (the field I want to study). He also keeps acting like I’m choosing something stupid or extremely far away, which isn’t true it’s one hour away. Our living situation is also getting worse. The house is old, too small, and literally falling apart. I’ve even been injured because of it. Honestly, moving out even just for a few days a week would be easier for everyone. My dad wants me to become an engineer and eventually “do something good” with the company. I don’t even disagree, except for the part where he insists I must study in our hometown. We keep arguing about it, and he’s even threatened to never support me again and told me to “fuck off and never come back.” What really bothers me is that my two older siblings did get the offer to go to a much better university 3–4 hours away, with a car and a condo included. He literally told them to go meet new people and build connections. They chose not to, but the option was there. I have no idea why I didn’t get the same offer, and honestly I was too scared to ask. It just feels unfair. He also said that any connections I make at the other university will be worthless because “those people will be broke 9–5 workers.” Which… is a ridiculous thing to say.\n\nMy dad nver went to university, has no hobbies, has a rocky relationship with my mom, and basically only lives for work. I think he’s projecting some of that onto me. The degree I want is 3 years, and even then he told me not to stay for the full 5-year course like my brothers did. I don’t know what to feel at this point. Am I in the wrong for wanting to go to the better university?
