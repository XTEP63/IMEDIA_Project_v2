We are keeping it small so that it’s cheaper and to make it a more intimate event. My sister is extremely catholic and has been anti lgbt since before I came out. I have decided not to invite her since she doesn’t believe our marriage will be a real marriage. For context, she’s married and although she always wanted kids, she had to get a hysterectomy for medical reasons. One of her religious arguments for being against lgbt and gay marriages is that they cannot produce life. She thinks marriage is between a man and a women who can be joined in sex only when there is no contraception and their sex act can produce baby. Since she has been so against my future marriage, I asked her if she still has sex with her husband. She was offended and said that it was not my business, but I pointed out that if she cannot have a baby due to her hysterectomy, she should not be having sex.

I have hundreds up in my home. It started when I was caring for my aunt with Alzheimer’s and has just gone from there. I have three kids and 4 grandkids and as you can imagine I love having photos of them up on my home. \n\nMy middle son Gavin (27) is no longer with my 4 y/o grandson Tommy’s mom, Helena. They’re still friendly and coparent well, and I see her often enough because I help with Tommy. Last year he married Cheri (also 27) after only being together a few months, but she seemed sweet and like she makes him happy. We had no issues until this summer, when my son asked me to down any and all pictures that Helena was in to make Cheri more comfortable. I don’t have any of her alone, just a few of the entire family and a few when Tommy was younger that my son is also in. I said no, it’s my home and I like having them up, I certainly have added many with Cheri in them but it’s stilly to take some down just because Helena and Gavin are no longer together. It’s stilly a part of our family history. \n\nHe asked again a few weeks ago and I gave him the same answer, and told him that I’d be happy to explain to Cheri, but he dropped it. \n\nHe called me yesterday and told me that it was the last time he was going to ask, the pictures needed to come down or Cheri wouldn’t come to our home anymore. I told him that was ridiculous, and he said that it was important to him because they made Cheri jealous and it was affecting the way she was treating Tommy. I am appalled. Apparently Tommy mentioned a picture in my house and Cheri threw a fit, and Gavin says that it’s making his life difficult. He brought it up around my daughter (the oldest) who told her younger sister as well, and they both agree Cheri is being ridiculous. \n\nI told him, if your wife is treating Tommy poorly because of some pictures in my home, then you need to think if this is the right person. Obviously he disagrees but has been hounding me leading up to Thanksgiving. My husband is also on the side of we do not negotiate with terrorists, but has also pointed out that they are married and we should pick our battles. I’m wondering if I’m missing the forest for the trees?\n\nJust a quick edit: if there was abuse I would have already called CPS. Cheri has decided when Tommy is there to make herself sparse and not be involved with him anymore. I have told Gavin that’s not acceptable and he says he’s working on it, but there is nothing to report. And Helena knows all of this. \n\nEdit: thanks, I won’t be removing anything and if Cheri wants to continue this toddler like temper tantrum she is welcome to stay home alone on Thanksgiving. If she wants to grow up and realize that she married a man with a child she can come, but I’ll be having a serious talk with my son. \n\nMy husband and I are well-off, and readily help our kids financially. He is welcome to cut me off over this but I doubt that will happen, as we will react likewise.

He work some days from home so sometimes he was over my apartment if his roommates were to loud.\n\nI came home from work on Saturday and Oscar wasn't home, I didn't pay attention although he was supposed to stay the weekend I went to take a shower and cleaned the bathroom, when I was changing the bag I noticed something moving and I freaked out I open the bag and found my little onion there without his tail barely moving I was so scare I put him in a shoebox and took him to the vet, the vet said he was too weak and more likely wouldn't survive, the vet gave him something for the pain and told me I could hold him if I wanted then he died 2 hours later.\n\nI was so sad and he obviously didn't get in the bin on his own so I called Oscar told him not to bother contacting me again because we were over.

I always assume this implies something like a driveway, otherwise they should say street parking. Before I arrived I asked if I could stay parked on the premises a few hours after I checkout of the room. They said yes if I paid them an extra $10. I accepted the request and paid via the Airbnb app because I was still under the impression that it was a parking spot that was either on the premises as stated or at least needed some kind of guest pass or residence permit. Otherwise why would I need to pay him? So I arrive and notice there is no driveway it’s just on the street. I parked and then asked if I needed a pass or permit to park. The host said I didn’t need anything. This made me realize it was a public street that was free to anyone anytime of day regardless of where they stayed.\n\nWhen I confronted the host about this in the Airbnb chat he said he had to charge me because he has charged other customers for the same thing and “it wouldn’t be fair” if he let me park for free when others have paid him. So he admits to charging multiple customers to park in a free parking spot that he has no right to charge for. He made an offer under false pretenses. When I confronted him further he said I would not get a refund for parking and that he “didn’t force me to pay” that he “just offered a deal that you accepted” and that I should have “done more research or asked more questions” about the street his house is on and realized I didn’t need to pay. This is an outright scam if you ask me. He shouldn’t be allowed to charge his guests to park in a spot that is public and free and that he has no control over. And then he blames me the guest for not questioning his scam earlier all while admitting to doing it to an untold number of previous guests. \n\nI reported this to Airbnb and while they are “still investigating the incident” over a week later and I haven’t gotten any money back yet, they must’ve contacted the host and threatened him with some type of suspension or expulsion because he messaged me again and said I ruined his only source of income. Part of me wanted to respond by saying he “should’ve done more research” on the consequences of the little scheme he was running, but part of me feels bad for potentially ruining his supposed only income over the $10 scam he got me with.

Ever since we dated, I have been the default driver. She gets stressed about driving and I get motion sickness unless I drive so it all kind of worked out. \n\nFor the last couple of years, we started a tradition during the holidays to drive about 5 hours to my wife's cousin's place. After we make plans to visit, all of the cousins would fly in from different states to join us. Since my MIL(78) lives near us, she would come along too. She used to make the drive herself in the past but cannot do it by herself anymore. While my MIL needs to make many pitstops, more than the average person, that doesn't bother me. I am happy to be the driver. We did this a handful of times with no issues. \n\nSo, the other day, my MIL was over at our house and we were talking about making the drive for another holiday get together. And then my MIL, out of nowhere, says, \"I would love that, if Bobby (me) would promise to drive safer.\" \n\nI was very confused about her criticism of my driving. First of all, she has never mentioned this before. Also, I get made fun of by my friends because I drive like a granny (no offense to grannies!). I mean, there is dangerous driving and then there are people who maybe drive with one hand or don't always abide by the 3- seconds-behind-the-car rule. I don't exactly count every time I get behind another vehicle but I keep a safe distance. Honestly, all I could think of that might be considered dangerous is that I tend to speed up to pass semi trucks because I don't like being behind them. Don't most people do this? I pass them in the left lane and get back in the right lane.\n\nI also want to add that any time I have a passenger in my vehicle, I am extra careful. In addition, since we have a 3 year old daughter, add another level of care. I was kind of flabbergasted that my MIL thinks my driving is at all dangerous. I asked her what she means and she mentioned that at the speed of 60 mph, I need at least 12 car lengths between the car in front. Who actually does this especially when there are many vehicles on the road? I don't mind driving but driving 5 hours, making sure we are safe, weighs heavily on me already. I don't need someone looking over my shoulder judging my driving. \n\nI was pretty heated inside and didn't respond to her immediately to which my MIL said, \"Bobby, it's rude to ignore me when I am talk to you.\" This made me even more angry. My wife immediately knew that I was not happy. She knows that when I get angry, I tend to not say anything because it is my defense mechanism from saying the wrong thing. Growing up, my dad was the kind of person who would not think before he opened is mouth during an argument. Even if he was right, his reactive responses would make him look dumb and wrong. \n\nI thought through what I should say and I said, \"I don't have to drive if my driving scares you. I can sit in the back and keep Lisa (my daughter) occupied.\" I was pretty proud of myself because I said it pretty calmly. I would have enjoyed not driving for once. My wife, trying to calm the situation, added, \"I can drive, no problem.\" \n\nAt this point, my MIL started to talk to me like I was 5. She said, \"That's not an adult response.\" At this point, I just lost it and said, \"It's fine if you don't like my driving. I think I am a pretty safe driver but if you don't like it, I don't have to drive. Tess (my wife) said she can drive. Problem solved.\" to which she started arguing about the rules of the road.\n\nI told her that I will be an even worse driver knowing I am being judged and second guessing myself. It's probably better if I don't drive at this point. Honestly, I don't remember how the heated moment ended but I have been stewing over this since. \n\nMy wife has been very supportive of me and kept asking me, \"are you really not going to drive us?\" Honestly, I don't want to.

I still remember the day they split they had this HUGE fight and my mom was saying some really awful stuff to my dad like calling him ugly and bald and all that. I didn’t think too much of it back then cuz couples say dumb things when they’re mad right? She hugged me said bye, and went to stay at my aunt’s. I really thought they’d calm down and fix it and we’d all laugh about it later lol but nope they actually separated.\n\nAt first I tried to keep good contact with my mom but it got weird real fast she started seeing someone almost immediately and it just felt off I casually asked her how she met him and she was like “oh Starbucks.” Then I asked the dude and he says they met at the gym?? Like hello??? Which one is it??? It just felt shady I asked her again once more and she got annoyed and super closed off so already something was weird but I didnt think much about it. Later I went to stay at my dad's and then I found out the real reason. I saw some texts on my dad’s phone between him and his brother asking about if he can offset alimony because of infidelity and all that I was hoping it was all some joke but I straight up asked him and he kinda danced around it but eventually admitted that she had an affair and everything suddenly made sense. The timing, the weird energy, how fast she moved on, the lies.\n\nBut the part that hit hardest was all those comments she said about my dad’s looks. Stuff I brushed off before suddenly came back and slapped me in the face cuz I literally look EXACTLY like my dad lmao he is 6'0 I am 6'2 we both have dark hair or atleast he used to he is bald now . Like she called him ugly and then I look in the mirror and I’m like oh cool so you basically meant me too and honestly that messed me up so much I’ve been thinking about plastic surgery I even had an online consultation with a surgeon in florida which is insane cuz I never cared that much before.\n\nOnce I figured out the affair I started avoiding her. I made excuses constantly, like “oh sorry I’m busy” or “I’m tired” when really I’d just feel physically sick thinking about seeing her. My chest would get tight and I’d get all weird and nauseous. So I just chose to stay with my dad mostly and the distance felt easier and of course my little brother copied me. He’s super shy and spends all his time with me. Once he saw I wasn’t going to mom’s place he didn’t wanna go either he is the kinda kid who would stop eating if I finish my meal he does everything I do but I promise I NEVER told him not to go he just refuses to go alone. He’s always been uncomfortable around new people and now mom literally moved her affair partner into the house. My brother takes MONTHS to warm up to ANYONE (it took him like a while to talk normally to some distant uncles lol) so yeah, he’s not vibing with the new guy at all and he just feels safer with me and dad.\n\nMom kept trying to meet up but I couldn’t do it. I finally texted her and explained everything how I knew about the affair, how her comments about dad made me feel like crap about myself and how I can’t be around her and how I don’t want a relationship with her right now and probable never. I told her I’m not stopping my brother from seeing her he just doesn’t want to go without me. My mom called my dad and accused him of separating her babies from us, it got so bad that my dad is asking me to visit her and i refuse to and i am certainly not gonna allow anyone to force my brother to see her as well.\n\nNow some relatives are telling that I'm being too harsh and that she’s still my mom but like she’s the one who blew up our family??? And I’m the one who has to deal with all the emotional fallout??? I don’t feel like I owe her a relationship at this point.\n\nAITA?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6boml/aita_for_not_wanting_a_relationship_with_my_mom/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6boml/aita_for_not_wanting_a_relationship_with_my_mom/","score":1207,"num_comments":248,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764075215.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

We were surprised to find out that I’m pregnant at the end of the first trimester, and am currently in the middle of my third trimester. \n\nFor context, Greg and his mom have a very unhealthy, codependent relationship with one another, and his mother also has difficulty with respecting boundaries. From the moment we told her we were expecting a baby, she has constantly been contacting Greg about decisions regarding our child- from what the baby’s name will be, to how soon we can travel to see their family, what kind of school the child will go to, even how we decide to decorate the nursery. Greg has tried to set the boundary that those decisions are to be made by us and not her, but she continues to push and I can see him starting to entertain her ideas- I don’t know if it’s to make her happy or if he’s letting her sway his choices. \n\nThe issue arose when I told Greg that when I give birth, I do not want a lot of people at the hospital, and I don’t feel comfortable with his mom being in the delivery room. Greg became extremely defensive and angry, and told me that I’m a selfish person for thinking me giving birth is about me. I tried to explain that me giving birth is about me and our child, but he disagreed, stating that it’s his baby too. He was even more upset when I said that I might want my own mom in the delivery room when I give birth, but not his. He said that if his mom can’t be there then my mom can’t be there either. \n\nI already barely have the energy to cater to his over the top family in general, and know that I definitely won’t be in a position to deal with them while I’m recovering and learning how to be a mom. We don’t have these issues with my family as they have 1) Been very welcoming to him from the beginning, and 2) Have always been very respectful of our boundaries. \nWe’ve barely been speaking and I’m constantly worried that he won’t respect my wishes or be a supportive partner to me when I need him most. \n\nAITAH for not wanting his mom/family in the hospital or in our home when I give birth? \n\nEDIT TO ADD:\nWe both became irate during this argument, and I told him that myself and our child need to be his top priority, NOT his mother. I made it clear to him that I am not a surrogate for he and his mother, and although I respect/admire her prior experience as a mother, she is NOT the mother to our child. We had been previously discussing marriage, and Greg said that he wants to marry me, but he doesn’t see us getting married if I can’t “learn to accept and be kind to his family” - even though I’ve let them use our house as an Air BNB and have catered to them (with kindness) every time they’ve visited. Even took time off from work to be present in case they needed anything, and driving them to and from the airport that’s nearly an hour away from us. I told Greg that if his family and especially his mother will always be a higher priority than me, then we definitely have no business ever being married, because I will NOT come after his family, and I will not let them prioritize themselves over my child. \n\nMy hands and feet became super swollen, and my brother’s girlfriend insisted on checking my blood pressure (she’s currently training to be a nurse in L&D) which happened to be high and nearing the dangerous levels of high. I ended up having my mom take me to L&D, where my blood pressure was 166/108, and the doctor diagnosed me with gestational hypertension. So on top of trying to keep myself from stressing too much, I now have to take blood pressure medication twice a day and have weekly blood pressure checks with my doctor. At this point I’m more worried for my child than I am for myself. I am seriously contemplating moving to my parents house until the baby comes.

Our parents did good by us, and I don't mind helping them out but I don't feel right giving my sister a pseudo free ride. She brags how she is ahead of the game for retirement and stuff. I told her of course she is, all her major expenses are covered by someone else. \n\nGenerally my parents feel I am being petty because it is a lot harder for my sister's age group. I reminded them it was hard for me also, but I had to make it work. For whatever reason they feel she has it so much harder and she needs this extra support. \n\nI agree maybe an aspect of jealousy is present because living at home was never an option for me. For my sister it was just assumed, but the other reality is my parents could not afford to let her live rent free if I was not helping them out. I pay their mortgage, insurance, and property taxes.\n\nThey suggested I use that many to help my sister instead so she can move out. WTF, she can afford to fly and stay in Japan for one month, she goes on multiple vactions a year and she needs help paying for rent? \n\nI get they are worried about her mental health she shuts down very easy, and in HS she had a bad stint with self medicating. So sure they are afraid of her going back down that rabbit hole. \n\nMaybe I am just being the jealous older sibling because I did not get the same type of love and care she did. I was old reliable.

I have an 8 year old daughter from a previous relationship and he has a 4 year old son from a previous relationship. My boyfriend and I have always bumped heads on parenting styles and discipline when it comes to the kids. Please give me some tips on how blended families get through this.\n\nHe has told me that his son is 4 years old and doesn’t know any better yet and my daughter is 8 and she should already know how to act. He’s complained about her on occasions and says that my daughter is disrespectful and that I coddle her too much and that it’s not right that I have to tell her more than once to do something. I say she’s a kid.  My daughter’s dad is in jail and no longer a part of her life so she craves that fatherly figure and affection. My boyfriend has shared custody of his son with the BM so the dynamic is a little different with the two kids. My boyfriend has refused to hold her hand or give her affection because he says it’s weird. He would get upset when she brought up old memories involving other male figures in her life and would tell her to go hold their hand instead. \n\nLast weekend he got upset because my daughter left her plate on the table after breakfast and told her to stop being a spoiled brat and to put her plate away. He had also been telling her to stop being a snitch earlier that day because she wanted to inform him that his son was doing something he wasn’t supposed to. \n\nIt really hurt me to see my daughter cry. I asked him why he was being so mean and to apologize to her but he refused. I kicked him out of my house. He says that I’m too dramatic and that calling someone a spoiled brat isn’t even that bad and that he wants to teach her how to be respectful and to listen to parents. Am I being too harsh kicking him out of my house?

{"id":"1p6bvdf","name":"t3_1p6bvdf","subreddit":"AITAH","author":"primeisok","title":"AITAH for not letting my sister’s fiancé move into my home","selftext":"A while back I posted something similar and got support, although this situation is both similar and different.\n\nI’ll start from the beginning, which would be roughly 3 years ago when my sister (26F) started to date Kevin (28M). I never liked him, and because I never really gave him a chance, he never liked me. At first, I thought it was me being an overprotective older brother which clouded my judgement, however my sister’s friends don’t like him either, and he got fired from his job earlier this year for behavioural issues, so that proves my point that he is a dick.\n\nHim losing his job is where this issue started. He lost his job two months before their rental contract was about to renew, and because they couldn’t afford the place on my sister’s wage alone, they had to move out. \n\nThey had three realistic options. First one was find a cheaper rental, but considering they had one income coming in, it would be difficult for them to find approval. Second option was they move in with Kevin’s parents, however my sister was very against this. Apparently his parents are very intrusive and don’t respect privacy, and they live over two hours away. This would mean my sister would have to travel roughly 2.5 hours each way to get to work, and she would be away from everyone in her life, it would be a complete disaster for her.\n\nThe final option is me. Our parents moved to Italy a few years ago so our mum can be closer to her family, and technically it made our dad closer to his family as they live in Greece… but it really isn’t viable for my sister to move to Italy. I did suggest it, definitely would be cheaper than Melbourne.\n\nI also said I would happily take my sister in. I live in a three bedroom house, so she can move into my guest room and use the main bathroom as her own, as I use my ensuite because it’s closer to my wardrobe. I do enjoy living alone, but I spent roughly 20 years living with her, so I have no issues with her moving in.\n\nI do have issues with Kevin moving in though. I don’t trust him in my place, I feel he would postpone finding work because I told my sister I expect no financial contribution from her, and instead she should look to save her money, and he would take advantage of that. And once again, and I can’t stress this enough, I don’t like the guy. I even told my sister my only rule is Kevin can’t come inside my house, let alone live with us.\n\nThankfully my sister agreed with my rule, and this undoubtedly has strained her relationship with Kevin. He moved back home, and they’ll be lucky to see each other once a fortnight. Kevin has gone through 4/5 stages of grief with me trying to get me to agree to let him move in. He still hasn’t accepted no for an answer, but honestly that really isn’t my problem.\n\nMy sister isn’t really arguing for him, and I was worried she would hold resentment towards me, but honestly it’s going fantastic. Our relationship hasn’t been affected, and she’s always been the tidier of the two of us, so the house is looking better than ever.\n\nI feel like the engagement will end however. I don’t necessarily feel bad that it might, but I did put an absolute massive wedge in between them. So, AITAH?\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6bvdf/aitah_for_not_letting_my_sisters_fiancé_move_into/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6bvdf/aitah_for_not_letting_my_sisters_fiancé_move_into/","score":890,"num_comments":115,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764075750.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

He has two children (18F and 13M) who he has with him 1-3 days a week. I own a home and prior to my boyfriend moving in, we talked about the extra household chores that would accrue due to more people in the house, and he assured me that he would help with more around the house so it wouldn't fall on me. He also assured me that he would take care of the extra groceries and the cost of other outings that we would do with his kids. \n\n  \nI keep a fairly detailed budget of my weekly, monthly and annual spending.

We both make approximately the same, and in the last 2 years he has earned more raises/bonuses than me. \n\n  \nRight now, we have our own personal checking/savings accounts, and we have one shared joint account where we deposit a fixed amount (50/50) each month.

There's my older sister (22f), my younger brother (16m) and my younger sister (14f). My older sister has level 3 autism. My youngest sister was born with brain damage. My younger brother was born with a part of his brain missing and chromosomal abnormalities. I have no disabilities or special needs and other than my siblings disabilities like theirs and autism are not in my family. Just putting that out there because I used to get asked a lot how I 'escaped' those kinds of problems.\n\nLike you can imagine there wasn't a whole lot of time for me growing up. More often than not my parents wanted me to babysit my older sister for them so they could focus on my younger siblings. There was a high expectation for me to be mature and extended family shared this. I was told there wasn't a whole lot of room for me to be a child. My parents also did some fucked up stuff. They did Angel Tree for my siblings every year but they wouldn't include me. So when lucky I got some dollar store Christmas presents. When unlucky I got some clothes. I would get into trouble if I ate snacks or made myself some food on busy days where my parents didn't have anything ready for me to eat. They used to say I wasted food by doing that and was eating too much. But I usually did this around 3pm or 4pm when I ate nothing at all those days.\n\nMy parents encouraged me to help care for my siblings. Stuff like lifting them out of wheelchairs (for my younger siblings) and changing diapers to feeding my older sister and trying to get her into her pjs at bed time.\n\nThey sent me into school on days I was sick and if I cried/complained they told me they had enough on their plates and they didn't have the energy to take care of me too. I got told no when I asked to visit friends houses.\n\nIf I had stuff that needed to be looked at or signed for school I was ignored and snapped at if I tried to force the issue. It was always later. They got me into trouble with several teachers because later never came. Then I learned to forge their signatures and it made that easier. But they never made time, even just one of them, to attend my parent teacher conferences and I did get shit for that over the years. Even when I explained things teachers always told me if I told my parents one of them would make the effort to come.\n\nMy birthdays went by uncelebrated most years. Sometimes a few from dad's family would acknowledge it and send me something but that wasn't a regular thing. I got shit from my parents when I didn't help out more as I got older. Or if I was doing homework in the kitchen and they wanted to make sure my sister got food in her because she'd throw it and fuck with my homework if we weren't careful.\n\nThen when I got a job I was told it was taking time away from my siblings who needed me to help out more. A few months before I moved out my dad stole $50 from me and that's when I knew I was done and I wanted to get away and be done. He didn't even try to deny it. Instead he was mad that I had money and didn't offer some to help my family. It turned into a fight that my grandparents and uncles (his parents and brothers) witnessed and they told me to cut him some slack because my parents were under a lot of stress.\n\nI moved out on my 18th birthday and stayed with a friend's family for a few months. Me and some other friends started renting our own place together after that and we don't live in the same state anymore. I live 16 hours away from my parents and siblings now.\n\nI blocked my parents and 90% of my extended family. The 10% I didn't block acted normal at first but now whenever they reach out they tell me I should have more grace for my parents and understand they were going through a lot. They said disowning my whole family is extreme and how will I feel when my siblings die or end up in care after our parents are gone.\n\nI don't think I owe my parents grace.

AITAH?","selftext":"My wife and I have been married for 15 years. Have 5 kids. Things haven’t always been perfect, but we have a beautiful family and we do love each other. We’ve hit a particularly rough patch and it looks like it might be the end for us. After an argument, my wife told me she was done. That she wanted me to move out and she was done. \n\nI refused to leave. One, because I wanted to keep working on it and didn’t think we could truly work on it living separate. Two, because I was worried about potential upcoming custody battles and had heard moving out beforehand could be a bad idea. Instead I moved to the couch. \n\nMonths passed. We were still intimate from time to time and would still do family activities. But I could tell she had pulled away. We eventually stopped being intimate. I fell into a depression. My side of the family was having a family reunion over my birthday. She would not be attending. She planned a work trip so that she wouldn’t have to go. Before I left for the trip, my wife told me that we were done, and that we needed to start looking into the logistics of splitting and divorce after I got back from my trip. This was it. \n\nTrip went fine, I had a good time with my kids and family. Was trying to enjoy the time I have with them due to the upcoming cluster we were about to put them through. When I got back I became increasingly more upset the more I thought of it. I did something I normally wouldn’t. I looked through my wife’s laptop and discovered a months long affair, starting in April of that year. It was currently the end of summer. I took the laptop and left, going to my in laws to stay the night. Between a text thread with this guy, and a text thread with her work friend, I discovered that she had a thing for a coworker shortly after starting a new position. She worked remotely, and this guy lived halfway across the country, but there were enough work trips and conferences where they could meet. It didn’t take long, when they met for drinks in Vegas, on my wife’s very first work conference. They staid up talking til the wee hours of the night, until they each went in their way. And that was the beginning of it. It was only emotional, nothing physical happened, in fact that was the only time they met in person. Except for one other time. In NYC. Over my birthday weekend. \n\nThe texts showed that they had planned to meet up in NYC a couple months back. They had been comparing work trip schedules, trying to find a trip where they could meet up. She started sending pictures of the hotel bed she was in, saying things like “big enough for two, you could have been here.”  They were FaceTiming and texting almost everyday. Many times while I was in the next room, on the couch, depressed and wondering how I could save my marriage. And they were going to meet in NYC. She spoke to her friend about what to do post coitus. It was going down. Then for whatever reason they started to grow a little more distant. And when they met in NYC, they met for coffee and she ended it. The last text I read was only a few days after that meeting. \n\nI was livid. She was mad I went through her texts (which I know is wrong and I’m working on it). I told her she cheated. She says she didn’t cheat, we were done. She had told me multiple times we were done. She had asked me to move out. I told her this isn’t some high school or college relationship. This is a marriage of 15 years. I was still trying to make it work. I didn’t know what to do, but I was trying in my way. I never thought that saying “we are done” means we can date other people. We’ve actually had the “do we date other people” conversation multiple times. We never had it this time. \n\nI compared her to Michael Scott, stepping out of his office and yelling “I declare bankruptcy!!!” And thinking that frees him from his debts.\n\nShe will only admit that she should have filed for divorce first. That she is sorry I am hurt. Will barely call it an emotional affair. And it’s the worst thing in the world. Not only to have to go through this feeling of betrayal. But to then have to convince their person who betrayed you that what they did is wrong?\n\nSo AITAH? Is she in the right with what she did?

I had opened up to my husband about my fears, about how it had been messing with me. He sincerely gave me his word that he is absolutely committed to the life we have here, that we will be coming back that he won't put us in harms way like that. He said his mom was difficult but stopping us from going back was not something she would ever do. So I chose to trust him.\n\nThe days leading up to the wedding were good maybe because we were all so busy with all the events. My son and I didn't get sick fortunately but my husband fell ill almost as soon as we landed. And my MIL was nice during those days, putting me front and centre in all the events, introducing me to everyone, and that half of the trip went well. After the wedding, my husband took the 3 of us for a couple of days to the northern mountainous part of the country (Bhurban). She had objected to that, saying these days were supposed to be for spending with them, and even insisted that we leave our son behind, but I was completely opposed to that. We had a good time there.\n\nWhen we came back she acted the way I had been dreading. Remarks about how my husband had made a mistake marrying someone in Canada. Apparently when him and her were out grocery shopping, she had lectured him on how he was supposed to have gone to Canada to study and make a professional career, not to find a girl, that she had raised him better than to only prioritize looks in a partner (which infuriating as it was, was also lowkey flattering lol). This is what I had needled out of him so the reality was worse I imagine. We had hosted some family friends of theirs one night, and when they left, she made it known how compatible their daughter would have been with my husband, how willing they had been etc. I'd kept the peace for his sake for the most part, but here I had snapped and told her she shouldn't have sent her son to Canada then, should've kept him here and had him marry a nice Pakistani girl. I later told him if she kept this up, we'd all be moving to a hotel for the remainder of the trip , and I think he spoke to her because she made the disrespect less explicit after that. But thats how the latter half went, I mostly either kept to our room or went with him wherever he took us.\n\nSo whatever its done now I guess, and our son was doted on by everyone there, and he was happy. His parents had brought up us moving to Pakistan or the UAE again the night before our flight back, my husband told them he'd recently been promoted, he had a career, we'd bought a house, we had a life in Canada. She got tearful again, about how little she gets to see us, as opposed to my parents who can visit whenever.\n\nThis is certainly not something we can do every year. His brother was getting married so we had to do this trip, but this is not how I want our family vacations to be. We need to be having vacations as a family just the 3 of us in places that arent Pakistan too, and I'm going to let him know about that. \n\nThank you to everyone whose given me advice and support in all this, I truly appreciate it.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6iovc/update_wibta_if_i_tell_my_husband_we_cant_take/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6iovc/update_wibta_if_i_tell_my_husband_we_cant_take/","score":214,"num_comments":24,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764091910.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Post Update","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

She then stated she is getting older, did not want to work anymore. We eventually agreed to let her move in down stairs in our home. She has a separate bathroom and living area, although shares the kitchen upstairs with us. \n\nSince she has been here I feel like we no longer have our own space and I cannot relax in my own home. MIL has a quite harsh personality and tries to be involved in all of our buisness. She continues to ignore my boundaries. For example, uses my dog going onto our bed while I'm gone as an excuse to go into our room and continuing to do so after being told to stay out of our room. Also, constantly asking us what our plans are, where we are going, what is in our packages ordered, personal life questions, etc. \n\nShe often also ignores my rules when it comes to my child (7 m) at times. These are usually small things, although I still find it frusturating. She does watch our son for 2 hours after school until I am off work 4 days a week. This does cut down on childcare costs, although is more stressful than hiring someone. Our previous babysitter would usually make our son a healthy snack then take him outside to play, read books, or do other activities inside. MIL does the bare minimum, usually sitting our son in front of the TV until I get home and feeding him junk even after I ask her not to.\n\nFor context, my husband often works out of town and is not home to help address these concerns while they are happening. I have made my boundaries very clear and MIL continues to ignore these.\n\nRecently, we found out that we are expecting another child. While we are very excited, this was not something we were expecting/planning. Having known our family would be growing, I would not have agreed to MIL moving in. The thought of dealing with this huge life change of another child with this living situation is stressing me. We also will no longer have any room for company to stay over once the nursary is set up.\n\nI have talked to my husband about these concerns and that I would like to start the conversation of her moving out. With the expectation that she can continue living here until we can find a place that is affordable enough for her being on a pension. I would also like to add that she is a very independant and capable woman. She has even been talking about finding a part-time job due to being bored since retiring 6 months ago.\n\nMy husband thinks I am being too harsh wanting to ask her to move out after only living with us for 6 months.

I made an anonymous account just in case any of my family used reddit. But here goes:\n My husband and I had a baby together. 8 years ago he got a vasectomy after having 2 other kids with his first wife. They are 22 and 17. Anyways, some family members know about his vasectomy. My SIL was not told about how we used a donor. Only our parents knew. We wanted to leave it to our son weather or not he wanted family to know. \nI ended up telling my husbands cousin for reasons I'm not going to share, but that is when she dropped the bombshell... my SIL had told her BEFORE WE EVEN GAVE BIRTH. She was SHOCKED when i told her i never told SIL. \nI asked my MIL and the SIL did ask about it but my MIL said to keep her mouth shut and her thoughts to herself. \nWe have Thanksgiving, and I'm livid. I want to address it with SIL, and just ask why would she take it upon herself to spread our business,  and how many people has she told, and why ? Just why?\nBut idk how to go about this. I'm still hormonal and I don't want to make a complete ass of myself. My MIL feels awful that her family has hurt me. \nThey truly are the nicest family ever. Ugh. Any advice?\nMy husband says he will support whatever i do. \n\nI'm not sure if I'm doing the update right, but after some really good advice i texed this:\n\nGood morning, hope all is well.  i just need to get this off of my chest so i can move on from it and let it go. \nCousin told me you told her about our son. It hurts my feelings because A: you never came to us to ask about anything and B: it just isn't something anyone should be talking about other than us, if we choose. \nWho else have you told? And please, just keep our family matters to yourself.  Or come talk to us. I'd rather that then people talking and gossiping behind our backs. \nWe will tell our son of course, but we wanted him to hear it from us, not through the grapevine. And our plan was to leave it to him if he wanted it out or not.  \nI don't think you meant any ill will or bad intentions. But I'm struggling with letting it go. So i just needed to get it off if my chest. \nI hope you have a good day. \n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6aexc/aitah_for_calling_out_my_sil_befire_thanksgiving/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6aexc/aitah_for_calling_out_my_sil_befire_thanksgiving/","score":157,"num_comments":99,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764071292.0,"edited":1764084789.0,"link_flair_text":"Post Update","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
{"id":"1p62g60","name":"t3_1p62g60","subreddit":"AITAH","author":"Ok-Bookkeeper-4633","title":"AITA for asking my husband if we can cut his mother off?","selftext":"I (28F) have been with my husband (27M) for 10 years, married for 3. And for the entire 10 years, his mother has made my life absolutely miserable.\n\nIt started literally the moment we got together. She used to talk shit about me to our nieces, who were six and two at the time. Then she spent years trying to pit me and my husband’s ex–sister-in-law against each other by making up lies about things we supposedly “said” or “did” to cause drama.\n\nYears ago, there was a huge blowup where my husband and his mom were screaming in each other’s faces because she kicked his dad out and got mad that we brought him coffee. She accused my husband of “choosing his father over her.” When I stepped in between them to stop it from escalating, she blamed the entire fight on me.\n\nNow to the present: His mother has custody of our two nieces (his sister’s daughters). The oldest (16) lives with my husband and me full-time, but my MIL still refuses to let us schedule her doctor or dentist appointments because “everything must go through her.” She wants to maintain control, even though she’s not the one actually raising her day-to-day.\n\nHere’s what makes it worse:\nShe still collects SNAP benefits and cash assistance for the niece who lives with us, and we see none of it.\nWe fully support her. Food, clothes, transportation, school needs, hygiene products, everything, but MIL keeps all of the benefits that are supposed to be for her.\n\nMy husband and I also pay for both girls’ phones. Recently we grounded the 16-year-old for using her phone inappropriately and lying to us. We didn’t fully take it away, we put parental controls on it so she could only call/text immediate family, including his mother.\n\nBut MIL blew up our phones demanding to know why she “couldn’t talk to her.” I explained calmly that actions have consequences and we’re trying to teach her responsibility. She still blamed me, calling me the bitch who was “keeping them apart” because she wanted to message her on Facebook, not just text or call.\n\nThen when our other niece and their cousin stayed over, MIL told them they weren’t allowed to use their phones at our house because “it wasn’t fair” to the grounded niece. Like… make it make sense.\n\nThere’s honestly so much more that I could write, but it would take a whole book. She gets mad when I pick up her slack providing for the girls (she’s on SSI, so money is tight), she constantly stirs drama, and she blames me for every single thing she doesn’t like. It has been like this for a decade.\n\nI finally asked my husband if we could cut his mother off completely. Not the nieces, we would never abandon them. Just his mother.\n\nBut now I’m second-guessing myself.\n\nAITA for asking my husband to cut his mother off after everything she’s put us through?\n\n Because some people are confused about some things such as: the dynamic of my MILs household, my husband not sticking up for me and the fact that I am unwilling to take in my other nieces. here is an update:\n\nI was giving examples of how my MIL has treated me and how she plays the system. I never said that I was unwilling to help the other 2. If they came to me, like the older one did and said that they needed my help to get out of that house I would help them in a heartbeat. I’m not saying that the benefit of food stamps wouldn’t help, I’m saying we are doing fine without it. It’s kind of a you have to be a part of it to understand. My MILs house is kind of like a mini cult. My MIL being the leader and everyone else in the house following suit as not to upset her because if you do that, all hell breaks loose. The house consists of my MIL(52), FIL(50) BIL(36), 2 younger children who are 13 and 6 and the father of the 3 children(35). Who is not related by blood to my husband. He is my SILs ex. When custody was established, he lost his rights to his children because of drugs and jail. He is also the one who bathes the younger child, cooks and cleans for both children, takes them and picks them up from school takes my MIL everywhere and can’t say no or she gets mad. He’s basically a live in nanny and chauffeur. My 2 niece’s dad slept with my husbands cousin and she had his children. So my nieces have a brother-cousin and a sister-cousin. Their brother-cousin is currently with a foster family because of drugs from his mother and father and the sister-cousin is the 3rd child that my MIL has custody of she got custody because she was the closest blood relative. It’s a very complicated situation and as I’ve said it’s kind of a you have to live it to understand it situation. It’s complete chaos. \n\nMy husband has stood up for me multiple times and my MIL then acts right for a while and then goes back to her normal. I understand that that is his mother and that is why I feel compelled to just suck it up and deal with it but it has been 10 years of disrespect when I have done nothing but love his family wholeheartedly and pick up where she lacks with Christmas, and birthday parties, hygiene products, basic necessities love and support. It never seems like it’s enough for her to view me as part of the family.

We are both 25F, have been good friends since the sixth grade, and live close to each other. \n\nI have SEVERE food allergies to sesame and nuts. This makes it really hard for me to eat at places that are Middle Eastern, Asian, or those healthy-food vegan places where they use nuts and sesame a lot. \n\nLeah and I have had a fantastic friendship EXCEPT that after fourteen f\\*\\*king years she cannot remember that I have food allergies. We meet up every weekend and she always suggests we go to eat at places where I am NOT COMFORTABLE EATING because they have sent me to the hospital before. She was THERE for one of the times I went to the ER. Every time I say I don't want to get Chinese or Lebanese or whatever she is somehow confused. I remind her that I can't eat literally any sesame or nuts or I will die, and she's like, \"Oh yeah, right. Never mind I guess.\" \n\nShe's big into healthy eating, and so likes vegan and East Asian-inspired foods. She liked to bond over cooking but she will literally pull out sesame oil or almond extract and I have to catch it before she uses it. I ALWAYS remind her of my allergies, but it's a 50/50 if she catches herself before using something I can't eat. If we're at my place, there are questions like, \"Can we add macadamia nuts to the cookies?\" This isn't every time, but I feel like it should be ZERO times. \n\nI know that people who don't have allergies can have a hard time understanding how scary they are, but after FOURTEEN YEARS it's really disconcerting that she cannot remember what will literally kill me. Outside of food we have a great friendship, and she doesn't have any trouble remembering anything else about me, my sister, my parents, my pets, etc., which makes this even weirder. I feel exhausted and like I'm always on my guard around her. I just can't explain another time. \n\nWould I be the AH if I told her I don't want to hang out anymore?

We each cook dinner one night a week and do the dishes one night a week. For our separate chores. It's my job to keep the floors clean, yard work (can be different depending on the time of year and stuff) and to take out the trash once a day. Amber (15) has to keep downstairs dusted, clean out mom's car and she has to take the laundry basket down to the laundry room once a day. Kayla (13) has to keep stuff like mirrors and photo frames clean, she has to help clean dad's car and then she folds the laundry for mom every day. The girls share their own bathroom and they're responsible for cleaning it too. I use the main bathroom and I help clean it but mom and dad use it to so we split it between us.\n\nMy sisters always sorta dragged their heels with their chores. They especially hated helping cook (when we were younger) and cooking dinner once a week now and doing the dishes and they hate cleaning their bathroom. So I used to offer to help but they'd just dump it on me. Like they'd go watch TV or leave to hang out with their friends and left me doing their chores for them. It pissed me off and they'd get mad at me for calling them out on it. My parents would say we shouldn't fight and they told me to let it go once the chores were done.\n\nMom was sick a while ago so I tried to help the best I could and it meant helping my sisters with their chores to make sure they were done but they just stopped doing them and called me a dumbass and saying it should be me doing all the chores anyway since I'm the oldest.

My sisters keep asking me and I keep saying no or ask mom and dad if you need help.\n\nMy parents are grumpy now because my sisters don't do a good job and they just want stuff done.

We have four indoor pets and five chickens, and cannot travel without someone watching the house and animals.\n\nMy husband brought up traveling north for his family’s Thanksgiving in mid-October.  For what we need in terms of house sitting/animal sitting, that’s not really enough notice to secure a sitter.\n\nI did inquire with the sitter anyway (we have limited options for a sitter due to geography and what all is required), but she already had plans for Thanksgiving.  I left it open ended, like “hey, do you have any availability on or around Thanksgiving?” So there could maybe be flexibility, but she responded that she’d be gone that whole week.  Normally if she wants to take a client, she’d say something like “but I’ll be back on such and such date,” but in this case she didn’t, so she’s not looking to work around the holidays.\n\nI told my husband this, and told him I wouldn’t feel great about spending our first Thanksgiving holiday as a married couple apart.

He came from a well off family and I came from “the other side of the tracks” some might say and I had been working since I was 16. So, when he saw me struggling at my job due to stress &  convinced me to quit so he could “take care of me” I ended up folding. He had plans to build a house for us on some land he owned and assured me we would only have to stay in his family’s home for a short time and as soon as we were married we’d start building and move out. \n\n**Noting that his sister & her family live basically 20ft from his parents—so they’re all pretty close. \n\nWe had a fun/relaxing time together in the beginning of our relationship, and I did odd jobs over the years (mostly photography)to feel like I was still a part of the world, but as time went by he still hadn’t proposed. We ended up dating until he finally proposed at the end of 2020(it was super sweet and felt worth the wait—he did some cool re-enactments from my favorite rom-coms). I then got caught in the whirlwind that is wedding planning with my MIL(as I’m estranged from my family) and, though stressful at times, it was a beautiful ceremony and honeymoon (this happened in 2022). Since we were with them for so long we had a decent amount of money saved up, and I assumed that once married (like we planned) we would move out of here. But, unfortunately, his parents began having health issues so we delayed our move.\n\n**I also need to clarify that the reason I’m estranged from my family is because my (now husband) told me I needed to go no contact with them due to certain family member’s drug addiction issues. It was the right decision because they were putting a lot of stress on me and I was getting crazy phone calls all hours of the night—among other things.\nI have less than 10 ppl in my whole family and they’re enablers to the ones with drug problems so that’s why I had to go no contact with them all. But it was hard nonetheless because of not having family there when I was married and just going through life without that part of me anymore. I still love my family they just weren’t respectful of my boundaries.\n\nFast forward to present day (2025), and (though we’ve began building our home) I’m now 33 and we’re STILL living with his family. \nOn top of everything, it turns out his parents health issues aren’t entirely because of natural causes. \n\nThis last year here has been hell, and a lot of hidden things have come to light. As his father’s auditory hallucinations and erratic behavior (what we assumed were early signs of dementia) turns out to be because of drug addiction. And his mother’s issues are from stress induced by his dad & sister. Oh yeah, to top it off, his sister has become an alcoholic who sends us ugly messages and hateful phone calls when she’s drunk. Let’s just say she’s the loud aggressive type of drunk.\nThat’s right, the VERY reason I can no longer see my family is the same thing that’s been slowly tearing his a part. \nI told him I’ve been patient long enough. \nI cut my family off. And though the said drug users have been sober now for a couple years my family holds animosity towards me, and I’ve been unable to mend that rift. I’ve accepted this fact and understand because I chose my husband (& our supposed future kids) as my new family.\nI even gave up a 9-5 job to start said family. \nAnd,ultimately, became his parent’s caregivers (thinking I was strengthening bonds with his family) only to feel like a fool for unknowingly taking care of a drug addict (as I previously stated I’ve struggled with my own family’s addiction issues my whole life so it’s a touchy subject for me). \n\nI feel so bad because I can tell he doesn’t want to leave his mom in this hellish state BUT every one here keeps enabling the dad and sister’s poor behavior (MIL is the worst as she lets them both talk ugly to her, even excusing their issues, and doesn’t try to leave or assert her boundaries). I had to block his sister on everything for my own peace but I can’t get away from people right across the hall from me. \nThis just isn’t what I signed up for, and I’m now starting to rethink having kids completely.\nBut this is a deal breaker for him as he’s always wanted to be a dad. I came from a broken home and I made it clear I didn’t want that for my kids but as time goes by it’s become quite obvious that the “no addicts in our lives” rule is only relevant to MY family not his. And when I think of how much time was wasted waiting for him to take action (marriage, kids, house building, moving, etc.)it makes me physically sick. So much so, that I actually ended up in the E.R. this week because I could no longer move my head due to neck pain. The doctors told me it was because of stress and put me on muscle relaxers. But every time I see any of his family I immediately tense back up and am hurting again. \nI just feel like his family’s peace is more important than my pain. \nIt’s making me begin to resent our whole relationship up to this point and I hate that. But I told him in the very beginning I didn’t want to wait till my 30s to start trying to have kids and here I am (33). It’s just so frustrating because I feel like I’ve lost my original goals and myself along the way. Meanwhile, he hasn’t had to sacrifice anything.\nAm I the asshole for being resentful towards my husband and no longer really wanting kids?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6eykl/aitah_for_being_resentful_towards_my_husband_and/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6eykl/aitah_for_being_resentful_towards_my_husband_and/","score":75,"num_comments":68,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764083607.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Currently I live in another country and she moved out of our hometown too but we stay constantly in touch. \n\nA few months ago she lost her grandpa and made a post about needing to talk to someone and distract herself. I called her and, in order to make her feel better, I decided to tell her my biggest secret, something that I've never told anyone else. It's nothing horrible or anything like that, but it's very very shameful to me and just don't want anyone seeing me that way. Now, we have always had the understanding that anything that we tell each other we'll end up telling our respective husbands since we share everything with them, but in this particular case I specifically asked her to never ever tell her husband and she promised she wouldn't.\n\n  \nFast forward a few months after that, when we both were visiting our hometown and met to have dinner, just the two of us. At one point in the evening, she confessed that she accidentally told her husband my secret. It's hard to explain briefly the way he found out but apparently what happened is that she told him that I shared with her a big secret and that she wasn't going to tell him what it was. That made him very curious and he tried to guess and insist that she tell him, but she didn't. Then one day, while they were talking about me, he set up a very clever trap for her. He said something as if he already knew what the secret was about (using one of his guesses), and my friend without even thinking agreed with him. Turns out his guess was right and she fell on the trap. After that, she told him the rest of the story. \n\n  \nI kinda brushed and laughed it off that night, but in reality I'm incredibly hurt by what happened. This is where I might be the asshole. It's been a few months since that and I never told her that I'm angry, I just slowly stopped talking to her, I don't take her phone calls and answer very briefly her messages.

I (37F) took him in after he was kicked out of my sister’s apartment because her new baby daddy (not his father) was verbally abusive to him. He originally moved in with my mother, but after a month she told him she no longer had room for him and sent him back to his mom (my sister). My family took him in as soon as we found out he was back at the apartment. When we took him to the apartment to talk to my sister and let her know we wanted to take him in, she just said “That’s fine. (Nephew’s name) go get a trash bag and get your stuff.” Literally no questions or concerns about the situation. This was back in January. \n\nFlash forward to today, end of November. Every year I send out Christmas cards that include a family photo. I wanted to give my nephew the option to be in the photo, but did not want to cause a fight with my older sister. I called her yesterday and said “As you know, we always send out Christmas cards. We will be taking the photo for the card this Friday and I’d like to offer (nephew) the option of being included since he lives with us.” I reminded her that in the past, we had a foreign exchange student live with us and we included her in our family photo. My older sister said that was fine with her and then changed the subject to her other son. \n\nThis morning, my nephew comes to my room crying because my older sister texted him to let him know she didn’t appreciate him being in the photo and knows “her opinion means nothing” and that he had turned his back on her and his half-siblings. \n\nI am furious. This is not the first time my older sister has acted fine with something while talking to me, then chewed my nephew out about how he had abandoned his “real family”. (The irony)\n\nPart of me wants to just ignore her and do the Christmas cards based off the conversation I had with her. Part of me wants to call her and tell her to cut the shit and stop doing an about face between conversations. My younger sister and husband both say I have to talk to her and stand up for my nephew because he gets so upset when she makes these comments.

This makes him cognitively the age of a teenager despite him being in his late 30s. My uncle has constant outbursts where he screams profanities and gets aggressive. He’s been like this my whole life, but in recent years it’s gotten better. My grandma has always been incredibly protective of him and lets a lot of his behavior slide. \nWhenever he gets agitated with someone she’ll just tell them that he’s cognitively challenged as if to excuse his behavior instead of it being an explanation for it. She’s enabled this for so long that he doesn’t listen to her most of the time. It’s embarrassing to say the least. Now, my in laws are completely the opposite. They’re very quiet and proper people. They flinch at profanities and are very calm and collected. I just married into the family this year, so it’s been quite the adjustment for me since they’re so different to what I was raised around. \nWe’re doing 2 baby showers, but one of them is for family and we’re going to my in laws house since they live 2 hours away. I told my grandma that I’d like for her to come, but as much as I love my uncle, I would like for him to stay home. I can tell my grandma’s heart sank the moment I said it.

The night before this all happened I couldn't get to sleep until about 5am, because I work nights and my nightshift sleep schedule often complicates my daytime obligations. Here is the rest of the timeline:\n\nAt 10am my boyfriend texted me that he was in the hospital, this was an hour before my class, a time that he would normally expect me to be awake. At 10:15am, my alarm for my 11am class rings, but I sleep through it. I miss my class at 11am as a result. Then at noon, he texts me his diagnosis that his cold, that he had since Thursday that we both thought wasn't getting worse, had developed into pneumonia. Finally, 3pm rolls around and I wake up to the mess I've slept through.\n\n I feel like the asshole. I called him and said I was sorry and that this wouldn't happen again, but also I asked why he didn't call me during this whole time, because I felt that, if I had just gotten a call from him and not just texts, that I would have been able to wake up earlier to show up for him. He said he didn't want to call because, at the time, he knew I had class soon and also he could barely talk because of the pneumonia. I think both of these points are valid, but I still think calling me, just to get my phone to ring, would have signaled the urgency of the situation more.\n\nI knew pleading my case wouldn't fix anything, but I wanted him to consider that this was unlike me to not show up, and that I had just made an honest mistake, and that, had I been awake it would have been different, based on my history. I brought up examples, like how I make an effort to go to all his performances that I can, pointed out how I almost never miss a call from him, and that I make it a priority to reply ASAP for all his texts. I also brought up how I've answered when he called before at 3am, to comfort him after he had to watch a close relative suddenly die at the hospital some months ago. He said this time was different than all of those other times, because this was an emergency that centered him, which was way more of a serious situation than all those examples about showing up that I mentioned. He said it was extra embarrassing, because this happened only a few days after he had let his family know about me, and they were asking where I was and why I hadn't shown up. It was literally the worst time for me to mess up like this. I don't deny that this was a way more dire situation.​\n\nHe expressed further that, he doesn't trust me to be there for emergencies now and that, if I wanted that to change, I would have to show him otherwise as time passes; I said it was valid to feel that way.\n\nI spoke to my friends and they are divided about whether or not I deserve more grace. Half of my friends said that, because he didn't call during the whole time he was in the hospital, that I should be given more grace, because it was an honest mistake to have overslept, I wasn't being malicious, and that two texts wasn't enough to communicate an emergency. The other half of my friends say that, even though he didn't call, I was already being irresponsible by oversleeping, plus he still texted during a time that we both knew I should have been awake anyway, and that just because it was not my intention to be malicious, that doesn't mean my absence won't be felt. I feel like all these points are valid, but I lean more with agreeing that I should have been awake by the time all this happened anyway because I did have other obligations.\n\nI know that, even though that this was accidental, my absence will still be felt by him and that it also looked very bad in front of his family, who he had just told about me. I know that, regardless of whether or not I am TA, that it will take time to make up for this and I intend to follow through with that.

We met on bumble and continued seeing each other every day after that for a week straight. He had previously made plans to travel somewhere for 2 weeks and he'd come back to our home country. This was fine by me since I hadn't grown super attached to him yet and i didn't take it personally. \n\nWe ended up spending a lot of time having late night talks in that one week we had known each other and he'd even drive/pick me up from my university which is about 1 hour away from our town. I felt that it was a mutual love-bombing-- even having slept with each other in that one week too. But it felt amazing regardless. I kind of just went with the flow & wanted to make the most of the short time we had before he had to fly off for his 2 week trip. \n\nThe day before his trip, we spend the whole day together, and he invites me to come over to his family home while he packs his bags. At this point he's still sort of like my situationship but I'm having too much fun to care about labels. In the midst of everything, his mom comes back home with his younger brother and starts telling him what to pack etc etc and I'm sitting in a corner afraid to take up space because i get nervous around people's parents. I introduced myself to his mom as his \"friend\" because I'm only now beginning to sense that we're going too fast.\n\nFast forward a few weeks, we do LDR for a while. Plus his career requires him to travel a lot so i dont mind. However, I notice that whenever he IS back, he seems super uninterested and disengaged in making conversation with me. He also seems to be acting incredibly immature. Refuses to get to know me better or take me out anywhere. \n\nI grow a bit uncomfortable at the thought of furthering this relationship and meeting his family because I felt that we weren't close enough for that. I've expressed this concern before but despite this, he romanticizes the idea of bringing me home to meet his mom/family which really puzzled me. \n\nOn another instance, sometime during Halloween-- my friends and I had just came back from a Halloween event. My boyfriend wasn't in town at that moment. We show up to eat at a local restaurant and I'm still in costume. It's not entirely appropriate but it's Halloween so who cares. At the restaurant, I bump into my boyfriend's younger brother and his mom. I say hi to them both but barely make conversation with his mother. I go about my day.\n\nFast forward another few weeks, my boyfriend and I get into a disagreement over the phone and I tell him I'm reconsidering being in a relationship with him. He's super unavailable and in the rare occasion that we DO go out, he's not PRESENT. He agrees that we should break up.\n\nBut. He suddenly brings up the topic of his family again. He reveals to me that his mother actually has a bad impression of me in the 2 entire times we have ever met. He adds that it was because I apparently hadn't given \"salaam\" to her in both instances when I bumped into her. He seems to get really fired up about this.\n\nFor context; my boyfriend and I were both raised Muslim so it is often a show of respect/etiquette to give \"salaam\" and shake hands with fellow (elder) Muslims. Personally, I'm not super religious so giving salaam is something I tend to overlook/don't think about at all. Mind you, him and I had LITERALLY slept with each other just a few nights before I had ever met his mother. Neither of us are \"traditional\" Muslims. So in my opinion, blowing up on me for not being a \"good Muslim\" is totally invalid in his pov.\n\nLook, I know some moms can be really harsh about who their sons are dating and maybe I should've done some things differently. But I've been feeling so shitty about this recently because his mom had no business forming opinions about a random girl that her son had been dating for barely a week. Let alone influence and raise him to become such a hypocrite.\n\nLet me know!

Growing up I never really made my sisters pay for anything and covered most things when we’re out and about. I’ve played uber driver essentially my whole life, spending hours moving them into college, driving them to and from places, covering rent deposits even when I was still in school paying my own rent, and doing things that generally my parents should’ve done. \n\nFast forward to now we’re all adults in our 20s. I essentially have stopped covering stuff for my middle sister because she has a full time job and masters degree. She gets upset when I don’t cover her stuff and nags me for staying with my parents and “using them despite how much money I make”. I do make twice her salary but I have >160k worth of school loans and my parents are doing me a huge favor by letting me stay home while I pay off my stuff. However aside from living at home, I’m pretty much financially independent. I should also mention that she also stays home for the same reason.. \n\nEverything came to a head when I called her out for her shitty behavior in getting mad at me for asking for a ride from the airport, even though just a few days prior she had me drop her off at some random party. She basically acted as if she had done me some huge elaborate favor and that I didn’t appreciate her when I felt like she could’ve said no if she didn’t want to. Not to mention I do these things for her constantly without complaining or asking for things in return. \n\nWe also got into a huge fight about her wanting to use a purse she gave me > 5 years ago for her first day of work, which she never told me about. She assumed that I knew every detail about her life and was even upset when I didn’t congratulate her on her new job, yet was upset that my mom told me about her job (indicating she never wanted me to know about it at all). I would’ve given her the purse back to borrow had she asked nicely but she came to my face cussing me out calling me “fat, ugly, selfish” for not letting her use it and that she never meant to give it to me over half a decade ago. I was eventually guilted into giving it to her, but she continued to blast my very personal life to my family which crossed the line for me. She has a foul mouth, which I’ve warned her about previously to be more mindful of how she uses her words because they may have consequences.. \n\nThat happened 5 months ago and I’ve cut her off since including blocking her on everything. Truthfully, I’ve never been happier. I think staying at home makes things awkward but I feel like a huge weight is lifted off my shoulders from not having to be around her constantly without complaining, nagging, verbal abuse, and constant need for favors despite being completely capable. I genuinely feel happier in many ways. \n\nRecently I heard her freaking out about someone eating her snacks and pointing fingers at me. She spent $3 on random chocolates accused me of eating her stuff, which I definitely did not. I just cannot believe someone can be so petty and honestly obnoxious. I proceeded to remove her access from my Amazon account and she sent me a long paragraph, which my other sister showed me, saying that I was pathetic and have nothing better to do in my free time but make things difficult for her. Mind her, this is my account that I pay for but allow my entire family access to. I never addressed her text. \n\nMy sister and I grew up incredibly close but in the recent year, she has just changed so much. She’s much more verbally aggressive and cusses people out when things don’t go her way. She is a few years younger than me so I get she may be more immature but I feel like she has regressed in the past year. Either that or her true colors are showing… she has also displayed multiple behaviors which indicate that she’s upset of my success such as sabotaging my grad gifts by threatening to throw them out and also expecting me to continually pay for her just because I make more. I will say she occasionally gets me like a pastry every now and then but it doesn’t nearly add up to anything I’ve done. And instead of doing it as a nice gesture, she tracks every nice deed she does and is extremely transactional. Meanwhile I never asked for anything in return (which is my fault and I have bad boundaries). \n\nI am trying to set boundaries now and am getting insane hate for it from my entire family. “She’s your sister how could you treat her like that?” Yet no one has asked, I am HER sister, how can she treat me like THAT? I also realize that a lot of this is small, petty shit and I don’t argue about this stuff with my youngest sister who I also treat similarly to my middle sister. My youngest sister is just more self aware, appreciative, and self sufficient. I think deep down i may also be upset because I never really had the cushion of an older sister and was truly independent for all of my life. She also is refusing to come to thanksgiving dinner if I show up so now I have to decide whether to go or get blamed for eternity for her absence. Im just tired of her. And I don’t see myself making up with her.. I can’t really subject myself to the stuff I was dealing with anymore, especially now that I have other real life stressors such as my career as a provider in the ICU. I feel pressured by my family to make up with her but I don’t think they understand (and also including my sister herself) the magnitude of her actions on me. I have to prioritize my own happiness and I can’t keep doing this sacrificial shit because it drains me dry. I think it would help to move out as well but it’s not financially responsible. \n\nSorry this is long but I’ve honestly had enough. Bottom line I cut my sister off, family thinks I’m a jerk for doing so partially because I’m the oldest daughter, however I feel much happier without her presence and don’t see us making up anytime soon.

We have been together alsmost 20 years, not sure what have changed him throughout the years, he's been obsessed with treating wife with no repesct means he's a real man and has the power in the relationship. He kept scored on everything he did, if he cleaned the kitchen, folding clothes is my job, and he take that seriously. If I'm sick and couldn't do the jobs that he assigned, he will put them on the side and wait til I'm recovered and do those duties. He also NEVER apologized if he did anything wrong because that's weak and not the alpha male behavior. If we had argument, he will give me silent treatment and sugarcoated like that's his way to shutting down the anger, but he doesn't care how I feel, if Im lucky he will be talking again in 3 days, if I'm unlucky, he won't talk for like 10 days. \n\nBy the way, we have a six year old girl. He's doing that to me in front of our daughter.\n\nFor example, when we went to pickup my daughter from art class, the pickup point is at the side door of school, because I read the email that teacher sent, I told him that's the pickup point. He immediately assumed I was wrong, which he does that on the daily basis, he thinks everything I said is wrong. He proceed to yell at me and told me “how dare I told him where the pick up point is”. And later he found out he was wrong, I politely asked him to apologize for his poor behavior towards me, he said he will never. I asked why I deserved this type of behavior literally on daily basis? He said he can say anything he wants. He saw the news about a man in Japan who didn't want to apologize to his wife so went on 30 years silent treatment, he thinks that's so amazing and that's a true man. \n\nThe last straw is that he yelled at me in front of his friends, so I talked back, I said don't talk to me like that, and when we got home, he's mad at me even talking back, so silent treatment again, today is day 3. \n\n He's not treating me like a wife, I am just someone who has the responsibility to share bills, cook, fold clothes, put my daughter to sleep, drive her to school. God forbid I forgot do any of these, I will be expecting his yelling and silent treatment.\n\n I am alone here in Canada, so I have no family home to go to, that's why I have been endure this for years. But I have reached a breaking point, I know deep down inside my heart, If one day something happens to me, he won’t even shed a tear, he will be like oh who’s gonna share my bills and who’s gonna fold those clothes. Oh I have no one to blame, I have no one to yell at now. This is very sad, I am not even crying while typing this, because there were SO MANY nights I cried myself to sleep, and he didn’t even care. \n\nSo, AITHA wanting a separation because my husband won't apologize to me?

The reason why I did it was so I can help out my husband with some of the bills since I am currently a stay at home mom with a 1 year old baby. \n\nI used to have a super close friend for over 10 years, but we recently had a fall out. And we rarely spoke anymore. One day I had a delivery to make and I told her I could come over to visit after since the delivery was close to her home. She mentioned that she wanted to try my cupcakes and I said sure.\nWe have been each other about 2 more times after and last time I went she said something along the lines of \"how is it possible I still haven't tried your cupcakes\" and I jokingly said you might need to place an order if you want them sooner (because thankfully im pretty booked) obviously I would not charge her, but in a way I meant that she had to wait because\n1. I don't just have cupcakes laying around in the house \n2. Unless someone places an order I am not baking for fun, much less with my baby. \nLiterally even my mom waited a long time before I made her some and she didn't complain. I know she has asked a few times but we only see each other once a month or so, and the times I can visit is because I don't have any orders to make and I can take a day. \n\n\nSo,  today I asked if she was free to meet up and she replied with this long message about how my comment made her feel like a stranger, and she couldn't believe I would ask her to place an order for something that probably costs me \"less than 1 dollar\" \nHer reasoning is that she wants her kids to try them and I explained to her that I am busy and she needs to wait, I told her that I wasn't serious about her placing an order but somehow my reasoning are not enough.

I found toilet paper on ny bathroom floor with poop on it (like it was used to wipe a butt and somehow??? Hit the floor??). My partner (M32) thinks that I (F27) drastically overreacted when I found this toilet paper on the floor. \n\nI went to use the washroom (note we have a toddler and a newborn) and as soon as I walked in I found a toonie size piece of toilet paper on the floor. It was about three feet from the base of the toilet, so it appeared to have been kicked? Maybe fallen out of underwear? I’m confused and grossed out. I struggle with some germaphobia regarding poop and pee and garbage so this triggers me. As soon as I see it I ask my partner to bring me some disinfecting wipes, and when he does he asks what’s wrong. Also note, this is not the first time I’ve found something like this. This has been an ongoing issue since our toddler was born. I have no idea how this happens.. why this happens.. I’m so confused how toilet paper with poop on it can end up on the floor. I’ve mentioned it to him in the past, and it’s embarrassing for everyone but he seemed to take what I said fairly well. But it doesn’t change. It gets better for a couple weeks and then I find something in the bathroom again, sometimes tracked out of the bathroom. \n\nSo I showed him, he saw it, he asked if it was from me or him and I said him. He just kinda shrugged it off as normal and walked out of the bathroom? I was annoyed but what can he done now, it’s already on the floor and I need to clean it up. (He knows I would want to clean it up to do it the way that makes me comfortable, he didn’t just walk away and not clean it fyi). So I disinfect the bathroom floor. I then proceed to steam mop my main living area (which is essentially the whole house). I was frustrated and short with everyone in the house during this process and holding a newborn while mopping. During mopping he told me to stop and that there were more important thinks to worries about. But like, I have a toddler and a newborn, I want clean floors. We also have cats and one struggles to clean herself and almost always has crusty poop on her butt and I think it’s disgusting and he seems to think it’s fairly normal for senior cats and something we just live with (but he has made an effort to make changes in her diet, litter, has wiped it off with a cat wipe just fyi). So yeah. I want a clean house free of harmful bacteria. \n\nSo AITAH for mopping the whole house after finding this toilet paper and just feeling so grossed out and reacting frustrated and grossed out?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p68vi8/aitah_for_mopping_the_whole_house_after_i_found/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p68vi8/aitah_for_mopping_the_whole_house_after_i_found/","score":36,"num_comments":67,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764065749.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

My dog was her best friend during her pregnancy with our first child,   and is super gentle with our children.  \n      \nWhen my wife was pregnant with our second child our dog started having some health issues, which is not uncommon as she is an older dog now. At the same time a couple of our friends had their dogs pass. \n\nMy now pregnant wife wanted another dog because she loved how good our dog was, and wanted it to learn from our current dog. Everybody (including myself) told her this was a bad idea, newborns and puppies at the same time are a lot. My wife though is the kind of person that when you say no, it only motivates her. \n\nShe did get research, she wanted something that was similar in activity level and trainability (current dog is a border collie/ blue heeler) but a bit bigger because she's nervous when i work nights, and a decent coat as we live where it gets cold. So she settled on a belgian shepherd, a groenendael.\n\nWhen our youngest was three months old I did a two day drive to go pick up the new puppy she had purchased. Initially she loved him, but now... not so much. He's honestly a good puppy (we went show line instead of working so he's calmer) but he wants attention, has energy, and needs reminders on training. Normal puppy stuff. To try and help I train the dog, wake up before work to walk him in the mornings, and try to take at least one cold and the dog on walks most days. \n\nNow she's mentioned on numerous occasions that she wants to sell him, that he's too needy,  chews up some things in the backyard, and doesn't always do what he's told.  And that she's overwhelmed some days between the puppy, our 3 year old, and our baby. \n\nThis is where I may be the AH. I said we are not getting rid of him. She was warned about how much work he would be, she has to live with her decision. And I like the dog. \n\nTL/DR: wife got a new dog while having a newborn despite warnings, now wants to get rid of it and I'm making us keep it.

So Monday night was when it happened, after my youngest sister comes home, my dad then brings my second sister home and begins to reprimand my youngest sister, each time my second sister is trying to instigate and rage-bait the youngest so she has an outburst, (she was already crying from my dad yelling at her) so i am telling her to stop talking which is getting ignored, and then my dad just leaves after believing the problem is solved, my second sister is still speaking and by this point my youngest sister is having an outburst and screaming how she didn’t know etc. So I tell my second sister to stop talking again and go to her room, i take her backpack to the bottom of the steps and she is in the kitchen now, I stay downstairs so she doesn’t mess with the youngest sister anymore and decide to be petty. \n\nAfter i heard my dad had taken her snack i decided to do the same, and i grab one too, and my second sister grabs my hand and tries to dig her nails into me, i am telling her to let go and my youngest sister is also trying to get her to let go but now she’s just trying to squeeze the both of us, i don’t let go and neither does she and by this time we are upstairs in the hallway, so i say “You have no reason to speak to your sister like you’re better and smarter, and you always steal her snacks regardless, let go of me and i’ll let go” (something along that). \nMy second sister just says I can’t say that and scratches my face, i had my glasses on so i just asked for my glasses and prepared to go to my room, she said no and wouldn’t let go of my glasses , now i’m holding her arm trying to get them out of her hand but she wont let go, and then she pulls my hair, our youngest sister sees this all and started screaming at her to stop, and it doesnt help that our dog was with us too so she thought we were playing and also started pulling on my hair, except they both wouldn’t let go, only when a piece of my hair came out, i called my second sister disrespectful and at this point i did hit her, i hit her across her head and i scratched her (we both sorta have no nails) \n\nafter that she tells me “congratulations you just ruined your life” and tries to get the youngest sister to call the police, she says no and wants to call our parents and by this point we’re back downstairs, i have my second sister in a sort of bear hug because i’m trying to get her to calm down, my youngest sister is trying to help but my second sister is flailing around, after i assumed she calmed down we go upstairs and before i can call my parents my sister runs outside to our neighbors house, a neighbor comes outside and my second sister is saying “i just got assaulted please call the police” and then the neighbor tried to meditate, we are just sitting outside and we all explain what happened, the neighbor came to the conclusion that i don’t listen to my sister and she doesn’t to me, which is true, \ni explained that situation with our mom and how i’m meant to look after my siblings and the neighbor says “you do have to listen to your older sister” which she didn’t like so my second sister started getting upset at the neighbor and yelled at him before walking across the street to another house, so i use all my adrenaline and manage to get her into the house, i asked my second sister if she’s going to keep going house to house until someone believes her own word (because she didn’t explain the situation only that i assaulted her). \n\nAnd now she is somewhat calm down, i’m able to call my parents and i tell them both what happened, i get yelled at and point out how i apologize, they speak to my youngest sister and she says the same thing, and then after that speak to my second sister and yell at her as-well. I show them the hair that was pulled out and then the night was over, my mom wanted my dad to take my sister to stay with him that night, but my dad refused and said “I don’t have time for this” Now it’s Tuesday and both my sisters are meant to go to school, and after it’s already passed the time school starts i see my second sister still home, so I had to call my parents and tell her she stayed home, they asked why she said she doesn’t feel good/stomach hurts, they get upset with her but it doesn’t go anywhere, and the entirety of Tuesday she stays home and in her room only coming out when she wants some food. \n\nNothing happens Tuesday and come Wednesday, my sister leaves in her ROTC uniform for school this time and I make sure my youngest sister is at school, i was sleep by this time but i wake back up at 1pm to a knock on the door, and after opening it it’s a police officer, he says he was called about an assault on Monday, and came to question me, i explain everything mentioned above that happened Monday and her staying home with me all day Tuesday and show the bruises i got from her and the hair she pulled out, after that the officer wanted me to sit in the back of the police car and spoke with his supervisors, i was in the backseat for about 5 minutes and then they scanned my id, they then go to my youngest sister school to question her, and after that the same officer comes back to ask me questions on how my second sister could be abusive (I don’t remember what they called it but they asked me questions like “Does the suspect control the victims daily activities” and “Does the victim believe the suspect could kill her”) and my mom is also watching me on the doorbell camera too, they ask if i wanna press charges i say no and then another person comes to fill out a warrant for my sister, after all of that my sister was taken out of school and to juvenile, my parents were mad at that and my dad even said she’s in there for no reason, but never put her accountable for it going this far. \n\nIt is now almost thanksgiving, my mom is coming home soon and we tried having a serious talk about this situation and nothing came of it. My mom spoke to my sister that Wednesday night about if she is sorry, and my second sister says she doesn’t feel sorry and she doesn’t feel safe at home, but after being released and speaking to my mom again she said she will be good and wants to come home\nIn my honest opinion i believe she doesn’t care about the situation and wanted me arrested with assault of a minor (she got charged with assault of a family member), it’s ringing in my head still her smiling about wanting to ruin my life, and i am truly upset with my parents for not holding her accountable, because even trying to talk to her she was trying to get things over with, when asked why she has a problem with me she brought up my fighting with her in middle school, and “she’s always on the phone with her boyfriend” and still no apology.\n\nI also genuinely believe she got some form of influence to go to the police at school instead from whoever she speaks to online, she is very clingy with her phone and once tried breaking my door down to get it back, and when trying to get my dad to look through it she was at his shoulder trying to snatch it back and close apps she didn’t want him to see. Throughout all of this my parents are putting all of us under blame and they are trying to say we just refuse to get along with each other, I want to know if they are right.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6bnw7/aitah_for_fighting_back_against_my_sister_and/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6bnw7/aitah_for_fighting_back_against_my_sister_and/","score":31,"num_comments":20,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764075156.0,"edited":1764077603.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I started an online college program through a college about an hour 1/2 away from my home. I chose this college because I already had a semesters worth of credits there and it was also where my father attended school and I stayed around that area growing up. I kind of had an emotional attachment to my university. I chose online because it was cheaper and it worked better with my schedule. \n\nJoe and I hung out a good part of the summer and I even got close with some of his friends as they all work with my mother as well, so everyone already kinda knew me just not on a personal level. At first we would just hang out maybe three days out of the month. Then by the end of summer we were hanging out twice a week. At first it was fun but it eventually got boring. \n\nI started college as soon as I got home from vacation. So I stayed home the first few days just so I could get into a routine. Eventually Joe and I started hanging out again while I was in school and it worked out perfectly for the first few weeks as I am a criminal justice major and he works in the criminal justice system. This soon turned into a routine. By the end of September early October we were hanging out while I did school work. This is where things took a turn though. \n\nAnyone who’s ever been to college or is actively in college knows that this time of year gets a little hectic because finals are coming up. My finals are next week, remember this. I told Joe that I wasn’t going to be able to hang out with him for basically the rest of the month. Anyone who knows me, knows I take my school work very seriously. I told him this because I wanted to take these next few weeks to get ready for finals. Immediately Joe says, “well you can just study at my house like you have most of the semester”. I told him no this isn’t just a weekly assignment or quiz. I needed to stay home and just sit with my notes and books to get ready for these test. He got upset and told me he didn’t understand the difference in now and the last few months. I tried to explain to him that I wanted to stay home and study and spend some time with my other friends. Once I told him that he immediately goes “what other friends? I’m the only friend you got” I shut that down immediately and told him I had other friends that I would like to spend time with and I wanted to spend time with my friends I have in a group I’m in at my college. He then tells me, “they aren’t really your friends, and that group you’re in ain’t nothing but a bunch of wh*re$. I immediately stand up for my girls and asked him wtf his problem was to which he replied, “those girls are not your friends they barely even know you, like I said I’m the only real friend you have”. At this point my feelings were hurt and I was on the verge of crying and I was pissed because he had never met any of my other friends. I made up an excuse saying my mom texted me to come home. He got mad and said it’s not even your curfew wtf is your moms deal, you’re a grown ass adult” (which I see his point there are times I get mad about my curfew but I still live under my parents roof and I have to go by their rules like it or not). I just told him “I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow, I have to get up early”, and I left. \n\nI brushed this incident off as he had been drinking and he just needed to go to bed. He immediately calls me when I get home because he has my location. I answer and he just keeps talking. After about an hour I tell him I have to go and he gets mad. \n\nWe were talking a few days ago and I told him I had recently gotten back in touch with a guy I went to high school with and had always had a crush on. (For context I have not been in a relationship since I was 15 years old). He asks me who it is and what he does and I told him. He immediately starts talking shit and I got pissed and told him, “you don’t even know him or what he’s been through and is still currently going through. Stop talking about someone you have never even met” (Context: he talks shit about all my friends no matter if he’s met them or not and even talks shit about my family sometimes) he asked me what my problem was and asked if I was in love with this guy. I just told him I was tired of him always talking shit about my other friends and telling me none of my other friends cared about me, just because he didn’t have any other friends. He got mad and once again said, “you don’t have any other friends, I’m the only real friend you have”. I just said whatever and told him I had to hang up. Two days ago I was on the phone with the guy I like and Joe try’s to call me. I told him I’m on the phone and he asked who it was and I told him. He says “oh so you’re like in love with him”. I just ignored it and went to sleep because it was around 3am. \n\n(Context: he has NEVER liked a single one of my other friends EVER! He has always found some reason they wasn’t good enough or tried to tell me to stop hanging out with them)\n\nHe texted me this morning and asked if we could hang out and I told him no I had plans with my friend Sadie (not her actual name). He got mad once again and said “so we just aren’t going to hang out at all until after I get back from a work trip then”. I told him probably not. I texted him this morning and told him I need to come to his house to get my hoodie I left over there and he asked why I needed to come get it. I just told him I wanted it back and I would be over there to get it later. \n\nI just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to cut him off completely because I know he will use everything I’ve ever told him against me and he’s petty enough to call my university to try and get me kicked out of school. So AITAH for wanting to cut him off completely? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6gwaf/aitah_for_wanting_to_cut_off_one_of_my_best/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6gwaf/aitah_for_wanting_to_cut_off_one_of_my_best/","score":29,"num_comments":17,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764087950.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Now I'm uninvited from holidays this year because I ruined their vacation...","selftext":"I (F30) graduated with my doctorate LAST year after years of school and studying during the pandemic. My graduate school was in Miami with a honor society brunch Friday, commencement Saturday, plus a pre-paid beach photoshoot I booked months in advance it was going to be a weekend full of events.\n\nEarlier that year, my cousin (F22) graduated states away. I couldn’t afford airfare, my car could not make that drive, but I sent a gift and watched her graduation online. Her dad got an airbnb for his parents, wife/my aunt (F58), their kids, my mother and her mom/our grandmother (my mom helped pitch in cost even as she and her mom/my grandmother shared a room). Apparently, they assumed we’d repeat that arrangement for *my* graduation.\n\nBecause they would have to pay to fly to Miami they refused to pitch in for an airbnb in Miami-dade area which was easily 3x more expensive then what they rented in Alabama for my cousin's graduation. My uncle could not attend and stay with my younger cousins so it would only be my grandmother, my aunt and her older daughter/my F22 cousin. My aunt and grandma wanted their *own* rooms, walking-distance to a beach, and close to a casino. Meanwhile, neither my credit card nor my mom’s combined could cover a Miami-area Airbnb for 5 adults by ourselves for what THEY wanted.\n\nI found a 1 bath, 3-bedroom split house 25 minutes from campus. I was going to share a bed with my mom. The cost only required them to contribute about $80 each, me too, and my cousin $50 for the initial deposit and the rest could be on my mom's credit card. They hated the airbnb as it was too “residential,” not beachfront, and 1.5 hours away from the casino they wanted. Given that they wanted to use my car on the trip this was the best option so that I could uber to brunch and my graduation photoshoot.\n\nOn top of that, my cousin had bought concert tickets for herself and my aunt days *after* my graduation and asked me to extend the Airbnb to accommodate them. This blew my mind! I made arrangements for Thursday to Monday and driving 10 hour back home with my mom. I could not pay to extent the airbnb for THEIR concert later that week on Thursday. Said they should get their own place after Monday if THEY were staying longer. I was told I was being self-absorbed, inconsiderate and acting like an snob?! But I don't even live in Miami anymore since I've been elsewhere for clinicals and attending courses virtually the last two semesters. I'm not staying longer than what I can afford now.\n\nAfter weeks of arguing about the location of the airbnb, I told them they were welcome to attend my graduation, but I would only be booking accommodations for my mom and me ONLY. They could plan their own vacation, hotel, transportation, etc for the 3 of them. In the end, none of them came...they sold those concert tickets and skipped my graduation entirely. My cousins and uncle watched my graduation online. The family group chat hated my graduation pictures with my graduation gown on the beach and said I was embarrassing them. My therapist suggested I unfriend my aunt, grandmother and godparents on social media after that.\n\nMonths later at my Aunt's at Christmas '24, my aunt shopped for the family as my uncle works full time and she didn’t get me anything because I was “on the naughty list for canceling her Miami vacation.” My uncle was horrified and apologized. I helped clean up after everyone opened THEIR presents (I had gifts from my mom and older cousin), gathered my things, said goodbye to my cousins and left. I’m frustrated and hurt but grandmother and aunt insists I was selfish and made the trip “impossible” for them?! I genuinely just wanted to celebrate my graduation but couldn’t afford to bankroll a 5+ day Miami vacation for multiple adults. I am not invited to Thanksgiving dinner this week nor Christmas this year to limit the \"drama\" because of my decision relating to the airbnb?

Every year, I spend Thanksgiving with his family and then visit my mom’s side later in the day since my parents are divorced. I make it a point to split the day between both families.\n\nThis year, my boyfriend’s mom invited me to their Thanksgiving three weeks ago. I accepted, just like I do every year.\n\nMy uncle on my dad’s side has never hosted Thanksgiving. They usually do not do anything for the holiday, but I still always stop by to visit. Last year I even brought them baked goods.\n\nFor context, I am currently staying with this uncle and my cousin because something horrible happened to my brother and me earlier this year. They took us in temporarily and I am very grateful. I try to be respectful and present.\n\nThree days before Thanksgiving, my uncle told me in person that they decided to have a Thanksgiving dinner at a restaurant, even though we are not sure what will be open. He asked what my plans were. I told him honestly that I was already planning to go to my boyfriend’s family’s Thanksgiving, which I was invited to weeks ago, and that I might visit my mom’s side afterward.\n\nHe got upset and told me I was prioritizing other people over my family and that I was choosing another family over my own. He said there was no compromise, and he also told me that if I was not going to prioritize them, he would not prioritize me. When I said that my boyfriend could become my family one day, he said the key word was “yet.”\n\nI tried to compromise and offered to come earlier, even around five, so I could still see them. He refused and said I had to come at the exact time they picked and spend the entire holiday with them or not come at all and even said again that I’m showing him that I don’t prioritize them. \n\nHe also pointed out that my brother is not going to my mom’s side this year and is only going to their dinner, as if that meant I should do the same.\n\nI feel like I am being guilt tripped for having plans that were made weeks ago.

{"id":"1p5zpds","name":"t3_1p5zpds","subreddit":"AITAH","author":"pixiebabe96","title":"AITA for wanting to leave my [29F] fiancé [32M] over his parents?","selftext":"This might be a longer post and I do apologize ahead of time, I just want to make sure people fully understand the situation I am in. My boyfriend, let’s call him “Lawrence”, and I have been together since April 2024, after talking for almost 2 months. We are technically engaged right now too. Ever since the very beginning, his parents have treated me and my kids like absolute garbage. I have 4 biological children [11M, 10M, 8M, and 5F]. Lawrence has one son, who’s 9. I have mentioned multiple times to Lawrence that if things keep happening with his parents, then I will be walking away from our relationship. He laughs every time and doesn’t believe me, which is my fault for not ever being more serious about it. He also says that’s not a real reason to leave someone and that it’s over reacting. I have no family, no one to talk to about this, and I’d like some outside perspective.\n\nI have known Lawrence and his whole family since I was 11. His younger brother was in my grade, and was one of my best friends for a long time. I even went to prom with his brother. I always had a crush on Lawrence back in the day, he said he had one for me too, but never had the chance to link up. Lawrence ended up dating a girl I was in high school with, that had CF and was very sick. They dated for a few months before she got pregnant, and she had their son a few months early. About 3 weeks after their son was born, she passed away from complications. She literally died in Lawrence’s arms, and he has been very messed up since. He hasn’t tried working through it at all. When his son was 6 months old, they both moved in with his mom (55F). Let me say, no matter what I say about his mother in my post, I will fully acknowledge the fact that she was the one that raised his son 95% of the time. Lawrence lost himself in his grief for years, and defaulted child raising to his mother for most of the time, even for a bit after moving in with me last year.\n\nEither way, when Lawrence and I first started talking, he would come up to my house and spend the night with me every weekend. Every time he did, his mom would contact me and freak out for him not being home with her and his son. Once we started dating officially, she pretended to my face to be nice, but she never showed any interest in my children at all except the occasional “hi, how are you?” She would still have his son most of the time, even for 2 weeks at a time, and fight Lawrence on bringing him back. She’d make up excuses about having plans but then never go. And when he wouldn’t be at her house, he would go to Lawrence’s dad’s house. So for the first few months after they moved in, we rarely had his son, so his son wasn’t really able to adjust to being around other kids or anything like that. Lawrence’s dad (57M) seemed to like me at first, but after a few months, Lawrence’s mom started saying I was “mistreating” his son so then his dad started being very mean and rude to me, and to my kids. Calling all of us names, and literally making up lies about me that I have since had proven to be false. She was saying I was mistreating him because I suggested to Lawrence that he should start helping his son be a little more independent. His son was 8 years old at the time, and could not poop in the bathroom alone. He needed Lawrence to hold his hand through the bathroom door. Any time his son had to share toys, he’d get upset and throw a fit. His son had 2 phones he’d play with, and it was made clear my kids couldn’t play with his phones but he could spend time on theirs. He also had a blanket that he needed to sleep, and would suck on the tag. I didn’t say anything for awhile but eventually I said he needed to start fixing these things. Lawrence’s mom has always infantilized his son, and that has always been a huge issue for us. Even now, when his son is now 9 years old, he cannot correctly dress himself or tie his shoes no matter how many times I have tried showing him, because “Nana” has always done everything for him.\n\nAfter a few months of dating, I started saying that I was kind of upset that his parents weren’t showing any interest in my kids at all. I said, even if they don’t care for me for any reason, they shouldn’t take it out on my kids, and that I don’t expect them to spend money on them or take them all at once, but at least hang out with them and get to know them. But his mom and dad said that wasn’t their responsibility to do. We ended up having to live with his mom for a few months while our water pipes were getting replaced, and things really escalated during that time. I understand having 2 extra adults and 5 children move in with you is very frustrating, but I did give her money for bills and whatnot, and bought groceries and things for the house. She went out of her way constantly to favor her “biological” grandson over my kids. (She always has emphasized the biological thing which is weird because she was a foster child that calls her foster mom, her mother). She let him do things she wouldn’t let the other kids do, she would only get him breakfast and then say my kids didn’t want food when she offered. She would let Lawrence’s son sleep in her bed every night, but not offer it for my kids (not that I ever would want them to anyway) but still. She also always complains that my 5 year old daughter is my “favorite” because she “gets the most attention” and “gets babied”, but she apparently doesn’t seem to realize that a 5 year old and a 9 year old are a lot different. Plus my daughter is medically fragile so she is bound to get a little more attention because of that.\n\nHis mom once watched the kids for a few hours while we went to look at a few apartments, and when we got back she was eating dinner with her other son, and that son’s girlfriend. She said she fed Lawrence’s son, but she wasn’t sure what to feed my children. By then it was 8:30pm, way past dinner time, and they kept bugging me they were hungry as soon as we got back. She let them go hungry. Another time, the kids’ school did a “Santa’s workshop” thing for the kids to buy presents for their family, so I set aside $10 for each child to take to school. The presents were between $0.25 and $2 each, so I figured that was plenty. On their lists, even for my children, I put they should buy lists for Lawrence’s parents, him and I, and our dog. I listed myself as “stepmom” on Lawrence’s son’s list, because I didn’t want to put “dad’s girlfriend” as I thought that sounded weird. Lawrence’s mom saw it, and she took the list out to Lawrence’s dad’s house to show him. (Background info, Lawrence’s dad is dating the 9 year old son’s maternal grandmother. A little twisted, I know). All 3 sat around, talking shit, they ended up scribbling my name off his shopping list completely, and they put an extra $40 in his envelope. So he ended up having $50 in total, and didn’t end up getting me anything. I’m not upset he didn’t get me anything, it isn’t his fault, but they didn’t even offer to give extra money for my kids, let alone $40 because that’s a bit much for that. My kids still got his parents presents because we didn’t see what they did with the list until after they went shopping at school. There’s multiple other instances like this, but you all get the idea I’m sure.\n\nAfter we moved out, Lawrence slowed down on letting his parents see his son for awhile because of the issues. We wanted to just be in our new place as a family, and adjust. She would show up at our new house unannounced, she would call Lawrence to get him to “go for a walk” with his son and meet her around the corner with him, so she could see him behind my back. She blames me, when it was truly his decision to slow down on visits. After a couple months of hardly any visits, both Lawrence’s parents plus the maternal grandma, filed family court visitation papers against Lawrence. They are currently taking him to court for visitation of his son. Like I said before, I am fully aware that his mom basically raised his son for 7-8 years. I know they have a close relationship, and I never wanted that to stop. All I ever asked was that my children were included, and taken into consideration. Even now, almost 2 years later, they still say that just because Lawrence took on 4 extra kids does not mean they should have to. They even said that to the judge at the last family court date. We have tried a few times over the last few months to meet them at the park by our house, and have cookouts every other weekend or so, so that all 3 grandparents could see him. And to give them a chance to start getting to know my kids. But every single time we have gone, towards the end of the cookout, Lawrence’s dad starts running his mouth about me and my kids in front of everyone. Calling me a “fat ct” or a “stupid fat b*h”, and calling my kids bastards, or saying something out my 8 year old sons father who passed away a few years ago. I have heard Lawrence defend me before, but there are times where he still vents to his parents about any issues we have and says that I am trying to get him to hate his parents. Which is not true, I would even be willing to look past everything, but they have made it very clear they will never accept my kids. All 3 grandparents have also ganged up on me, together and with Lawrence once, yelling and screaming at me about all the issues we’ve had. And I will admit, in the few times we have argued like that, I have said some mean shit in defense of myself. Some of it actually being true but worded rudely, and some of it just because I was mad (example being I accused his mother of being emotionally incest with Lawrence due to him moving in after his sons mother died, and she took on the “mom” role and almost like relationship role due to things I’ve been told and have seen myself). But I have NEVER just said anything crazy or been mean out of nowhere, and even months after his parents first started treating me badly, I was still trying very hard to be nice.\n\nI know that I shouldn’t have to deal with all this, and neither should my kids. However, every time Lawrence says it’s not normal to leave a relationship over someone’s parents, I start to think I might be over reacting. I am very close to walking away, but i don’t know if that is wrong of me to do or not. Like I said, I just have no one to talk to about this, and I want unbiased opinions please. And if I’m in the wrong, I want to know so I can try to fix whatever it is. Thank you for your time, and again I apologize this was so long.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p5zpds/aita_for_wanting_to_leave_my_29f_fiancé_32m_over/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p5zpds/aita_for_wanting_to_leave_my_29f_fiancé_32m_over/","score":19,"num_comments":67,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764034741.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

That being said, this is not one of them. This is the unedited truth of my stance and what may or may not be a**hole behavior when cutting out family who didnt break the cycle of abuse.\nSo now into the meat of the story. I lost half of my father's family when I started going to therapy. Slowly one at a time I lost their support. But I'm sure the nail in the coffin came when I was 16 years old, I was adamant against a plan my father expected me to go through with. He wanted me to go at 18 to change my name to take his last name and bring honor back to him and his side of the family. He wanted me to change my last name to match his after 16 years of knowing he wasn't on my birth certificate so he could hide my existence from his family for years. 16 years raised as a Newton meant more to me than keeping in touch with any of the Nagy family who had for the most part treated me like an add on, not quite feeling they saw me as family. I've only seen my father's parents during celebrations for other family members. So them cutting me out didn't hurt. Then when I got my girlfriend pregnant in highschool, they became adamant that I must name my son to honor a family name on their side. I refused completely. I would never name my son for my abusive father or his abusive father. My father died this year, I cut him out about 3 to 4 years ago when it became obvious he was incapable of change. His family cut me out slowly after I started posting 4 years ago about my father being abusive. They can demand all they want. The secrets coming out is something they fear not me. They will never meet my child. Not once until he turns 18. They wanted to use force to make me name my son the family name, after over a decade of treating me like less than family. They will never meet my son. I don't think any of my fathers siblings or his parents are capable of lasting change. So why should I let them back into my life? I've lived my life as a Newton, I had my son take the last name of Newton, I will be published one day (God willing) as a Newton, I will die as a Newton. My mothers maiden name will be honored because that side of the family has not seen me as less than anyone else. They showed me what being a man is, not my parents, not the Nagy family, my mothers parents did.\nI used the real last names because they are afraid of the truth but I am not. They won't be in my life because they never made an effort to be in my life anyway.\nI know some will say I am faking, but this has been an expression of truth, no lies, no agenda, just the facts of where I stand and why. I have cousins I miss on that side, but I barely got to know them growing up anyway. They made no effort beyond a push for control. I pushed back and I stand firm. The Nagy family will not know my son until he is 18 and can decide for himself what he wants to do when it comes to the toxic Nagy family. I may be the a**hole but I am not hiding secrets for the family of my dead abuser anymore. My child will not struggle to fit into a family that put no effort into knowing me or my son. Until they mature and make efforts to change that stick, the Nagy name means nothing to me. There is only one Nagy I won't cut out because she has always treated me right, that is my younger sister. All respect goes to family that showed respect the whole time. I have no respect for people who disrespected me my whole existence. So am I the unreasonable person here? Am I really the a**hole?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6odr8/aitah_for_cutting_out_family_and_refusing_to_let/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6odr8/aitah_for_cutting_out_family_and_refusing_to_let/","score":13,"num_comments":12,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764104478.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I (39/M) am broken from my childhood (SA, cops every weekend, physical and mental abuse, and suicide). There is no advice that will change my idea of my mother's current husband, Ill call him Ed. There's not enough time and words that can explain how he has fucked with my head except ill try in one story (the tip). When I moved out I had a half sister that used to run to my bed and want protection when Ed beat my mother. This finally ended with my mother laying down crying in my lap and me at 16 telling him if he touches her again I will \"fucking kill you\". I still feel like a coward for letting it go on so long. Anyway back to the point. I moved out as a decision that I was the lightning rod and never wanted (information reinforced through yelling at me during 2-3 hour long lectures where I wasnt allowed to sit. I later found out that Ed had given my sister (his daughter, my half sister) a phone number to a burner phone he had set up and said call and see if he cares because my sister kept asking where I was. \n\nOK now on to why im asking if iatah. I have an amazing family I never thought I wanted because I AM not good enough. Strong, but never thought id be a good enough father. During covid my wife and I became pregnant with our first son. I asked my mom (to clarify she is my bio mom and I dont know my real father) to come over and she refused. Now I didn't tell her the reason as I wanted it to be a surprise. She's always wanted grandkids and I told her dont look to me because I will never.  She flat out refused to come over. We'd had a falling out for the 4th time and this was my olive branch to mend the relationship, she is my mother even if she picks money over blood. I finally told her we were having a boy and all she said was oh I thought you wanted to tell us you were getting married. I was done. The straw that broke the camels back? No that came later but just another for the pile. Fast forward we've had a second child and now my mother asks to come over. In the call she says Ed needs to be there. I say I want nothing to do with him, I've never wanted anything to do with him and he gets on the phone and says \"Yes we've done things to you but you just have to suck it up and make nice as we are family\" I tell my mother that she is welcome anytime but she is not to bring her current husband. To this day I've refused to let her come over because anytime we've had the conversation she's asked if Ed can come over too almost as if I never told her no.

My mom and bio dad were married and had three kids (my older siblings) and bio dad died when my siblings were 9, 8 and 6. A few weeks later mom found out she was pregnant with me and I was born several months after my bio dad died.\n\nI was 2 when my mom married my adoptive dad. He adopted me when I was 4. I don't remember being adopted. I don't remember life without my adoptive dad. Until I was 12 I felt truly loved by him and like he considered me his own.\n\nBut our family was pretty broken. My siblings hated that mom remarried and they hated mom for letting me be adopted. She told them she wanted that for all of us because she wanted us all to have a living father and that my adoptive dad would love to be there for all of us. She admitted to them that one of the reasons she married my adoptive dad in the timeline she did was she wanted us all to have a dad around again. They would get so mad at that and said if she wanted to replace bio dad and didn't give a fuck about him anymore then fuck her but leave them out of it because they would never let someone replace him.\n\nWhile my siblings lived at home there were daily fights. And I mean every day. If they didn't fight mom together it could mean three fights a day. My adoptive dad was shut out by them. They got mad if he offered any help and they constantly told him to leave them alone and he should just leave because nobody wanted him there.\n\nBecause I called him dad they would walk around mad at me. They told me he wasn't my real dad and how could I do that to our dad. The guy who made me. I told them I had two dad's but I didn't remember bio dad like they did. They said I had no loyalty and they wished I had never been born if I was going to disrespect bio dad like that. Our relationship never improved and I don't think they love me at all. They see me as only my adoptive dad's kid now and to me it feels like that makes me not their sister in their eyes.\n\nMy siblings don't live with us anymore but the limited contact they have with mom is still all fights. She wants a relationship but gets mad at them and they still hate her. There was 2 or 3 years where there was no contact at all.\n\nWhen I was 12 my adoptive dad pulled away and I heard him say we weren't worth all the stress and that he only stayed because he didn't want to pay child support for me. He openly admitted to cheating on mom because he was tired of being with her. But he adopted me so if they divorce he's on the hook for support. I don't have a dad anymore and mom doesn't pay any attention to me. She walks around pissed off most of the time and if I try to talk to her I get to experience all that anger she has.\n\nMy siblings just ignore me now. They told our cousin to tell me that I was not a part of their life and I needed to let go, so that's what I did.\n\nI feel disconnected from everyone and talking just isn't enough. I have tried. I get ignored. My adoptive dad told me to stop calling him dad when I was 13. My mom acts like I'm bothering her even saying morning to her.\n\nFor a while now I've thought about leaving after my birthday and just going somewhere else, changing my number and being done. But then I feel guilty for being so done with my family when they are my family. I just don't feel like anyone wants me or cares about me and I feel like I'll grow depressed if I make all the effort to get treated like shit in response.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6ml0y/wibtah_if_i_walk_away_from_my_whole_family/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6ml0y/wibtah_if_i_walk_away_from_my_whole_family/","score":13,"num_comments":11,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764100415.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

It's honestly not her fault, I am just too sensitive. because she like talking about GDP growth, government policies or economics in every conversation every time we hang out. But it makes me really sad because I know I would never be able to talk about country because what my people worry about every day is if a bomb will drop on their head, or if they can feed their children.

I assumed nothing, just thought it would be nice.\n\nFor context: I’ve planned multiple baby showers for both family and friends over the years. I went *all out* — buying decorations, organising food, paying for extras, making sure they felt special. I genuinely did it because I love them, not because I expected anything in return.\n\nI mentioned a few times that I would love some help planning mine. My twin said she would and then backed out. My mum planned one for my sister with her child years ago but never offered to help me.\n\nI’m also the last in my friend group and family to have kids. I watched everyone else get showers, support, excitement, and planning chats. When we finally got pregnant, I thought it would be nice if people returned some of the energy I’d always given them — but again, I had no real expectations.\n\nSo I ended up planning the whole thing myself. Every detail. And honestly? I have no regrets. It’s exactly how I want it, on my own terms. But I can’t lie — I’m also hurt that all the effort I’ve put into others’ milestones wasn’t reciprocated at all and wish I had this realisation sooner.\n\nI didn’t expect people to pay for anything, or throw some massive party. I literally offered to pay myself and said we don't need gifts. I just thought it would be nice if there was some effort, excitement, or participation — something small. Especially considering how much this pregnancy means to us.\n\nSome people have told me, “You should’ve asked directly,” or “People don’t know unless you tell them,” or “You’re just hormonal.” But I did bring it up, clearly and politely. It just never went anywhere.\n\nSo, Reddit: AITA for being upset that no one offered to plan my baby shower, even though I ended up planning it myself on my own terms and had no expectations?\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p617p8/aitah_for_being_upset_that_i_had_to_plan_my_baby/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p617p8/aitah_for_being_upset_that_i_had_to_plan_my_baby/","score":12,"num_comments":17,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764039020.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
{"id":"1p6tnuj","name":"t3_1p6tnuj","subreddit":"AITAH","author":"Wise-Maintenance5590","title":"AITA for kicking my wife out of the house?","selftext":"TL;DR  Husband and wife have mental health issues. Have 2 children from prior relationships. Her son is a 🍆.she had a bad reaction to her medicine. Son wanted a ride to work: wife in & out of consciousness. Wife demanded take son to work. Son smug. Husband verbally reams son out on way to work. Husband returns home and takes wife to hospital. Wife kept for a couple of days to monitor.\n\nIn between, mentions of couples counseling. Wife seems pretty much checked out of marriage anyway. After released from hospital, wife visits son in his hotel (husband verbally denounced him. His feelings hurt) Argument happens and husband sends wife away. Wife has friends, family, and church support system to help her. Talks 💩 about husband.\n\nHusband (OP) needs advice\n\n\n\n\n\nI don't know how this will be taken so please bear with me. And it is kind of long, do forgive me for that.\n\nLiving arrangements, myself and my wife, my daughter (15F) from a previous marriage and my wife's son (24M) all live in the house. This is important for late on.\n\nI (40M) and my wife (49F) have been married for 5 years. She and I both have behavioral health issues that we manage differently. When we first started dating we both were honest and up front about this and discussed it at length before continuing on with the relationship.\n\nShe manages hers with proper medicine and seen a psychiatrist, who by the way, is an amazing doctor. She's helped out my wife tremendously for the last 3 years and got her on track with the right medicine that my wife found herself comfortable with.\n\nI on the other hand, due to a series of poor decisions, nearly ended up not being on this world due to my depression at the time.  I made it my goal at that time to have an intense medicine regimen and work on my coping mechanisms as I made it my goal to not take any prescribed medicine. It worked.\n\nNow, for the better part of the last two years, my wife and I drifted apart  both physically, mentally, and emotionally to the point that we had not been intimate for the last 18 months or so. I know we both felt terrible in this situation and I knew it was because we both have issues from our behavioral health issues.  We both worked, however, my job was a two hour commute one way, so this I know, placed a strain on our relationship as I was not able to be home as much as I wanted to be.\n\nMy wife worked as well and she enjoyed her job as she was able to work whatever hours she wanted and take on clients that she wanted.  It was perfect for her and her condition.  I was extremely overjoyed when she was hired for this position.\n\nNow to the present. We had discussions the last 4 months about our lack of intimacy, however hard and difficult the conversation was for both of us, we both decided to make a combined effort to rekindle our physical relationship. Not just by going on dates but by talking with one another about our needs and wants. She decided that going to marriage counseling would help out our situation, I agreed to go as long as we both saw our own individual therapists.  We agreed.\n\nThe marriage counseling started out really well, but as we talked more and more, it was becoming clearer to me that my wife was not all in, so to speak. I started to pay more attention to her and her mannerisms and it seemed to me that something was off.\n\nThings went bad one night when she was not feeling too well one night after taking her medicine. She looked like she was about to faint and she was slurring her words more than normal as her medicine usually makes her really sleepy. Usually after she takes her medicine, she goes straight to bed, and before I go to my office and work on email responses, I make sure she's fully asleep since she's not coherent enough around that time at night.\n\nThis one time her medicine hit her so hard that she passed out and literally collapse on the floor to my daughters room. I rushed to her and picked her up immediately, carrying her chair. It was at this time that my stepson was standing near the front entrance asking for a ride to his job, bags in hand and all ready to go.  HE MADE NO EFFORT TO HELP ME WITH HIS MOM AT ALL!!! He just stood there asking if I could take him to work, despite him seeing his mom passed out on the living room chair. I about lost it and called him a useless coward and told him that I was disappointed in him for his lack of empathy.\n\nMy wife despite being drugged and coming to and from unconsciousness said that I should take her son to work.  Grudgingly, I did. And on the way there, tore into him. And the whole drive there, he had a smug look on his face that if I didn't have to take my wife to the hospital, I would have seriously punched his lights out. When I got back home, my daughter had been taking care of my wife and helped me get her to the car to go to the ER.\n\nWhen we got to the ER, and she was evaluated, her blood pressure was alternating between the 70/40 and 60/25. I'm no doctor, and I knew that was bad. She was kept over the weekend on observation and released under the diagnosis that it was her medicine and overworked schedule that got her into that position.  Well, when she found out that I curse, yelled, and outright called her son a useless coward for his lack of empathy and inability to help his mom, she took his side.\n\nAnd that's when things got even worse. The next day she picked up her son  from a hotel he stayed at the night since apparently I was abusive to him, even though I called him out on his behavior, and they both went to one of her clients house and were there for an hour.\n\nNeedless to say, when she finally dropped her son off at the hotel he was in, she finally answered my call and told me that she was going to move out since I was insufferable to live with and that I shouldn't have spoken to her son like that. That her son and her were going to move in with her client.\n\nBy this point I told her we can talk more when she got home.  The conversation went as well as you can imagine. She told me that our lack of intimacy was hurting us, that MY behavioral health problems were something she couldn't deal with.  Despite having her being hospitalized 5 times since we had been married and one of them a purposeful overdose.  She also told me that her client and her had talked about me since March of this year and that she was planning on leaving me May of next year.  That she was just letting things playout until she had all her stuff in order so she could leave with her son.\n\nI asked her why it was that despite me having small episodes once in a blue moon and not having to be hospitalized, that I was \"hard to live with?\"  She said that she couldn't take it anymore and that she needed space from me.  I told here that what she did with her client was an outright emotional affair.  That what she did was not ok.  I even looked it up online and showed her what an emotional affair was.  She wasn't budging.\n\nAt this point, I was furious, mad, betrayed, abandoned, and despite my best efforts to go to marriage counseling and make things works, I was being played with till she was ready to leave me. I told her I wanted her out of the house before my daughter got home from school.  The look on my face was not one of grief anymore, it was out of pure detachment at this point.  She looked at me with surprise and asked why?  Again, with as much rage as I had within me, I turned and looked at her with the most cold eyes I could manage and told her to leave. She tried to bargain with me and ask if she could stay till at least the end of the year. I told her know and that she needed to pack whatever she could and that she could go live with her client since he had been the one to make her the offer since March.\n\nShe packed some of her things and left that day.  I was devastated.  Since then she has scrambled to get a place, asked family for help, asked her church for help, asked her friends for help, and all have been willing to help her, which don't get me wrong, I'm glad they did. But to everyone she's talked with, I am the abusive soon to be ex husband. Her abuser, her tormentor.\n\nThe one time that I needed her to be there for me, to support me with my behavioral health issues, to just let me know that things were going to be ok, she thought it was too much. Despite me being there for her through her issues and her hospitalizations. Before she left I asked her why she chose her son's side.  She told me that despite us being married for five years and everything we had been through, that her son was never going to leave her. At that point, I realized that marriage meant nothing to her, and I told her as much.  That she had herself turned into the person HER ex had been towards her.\n\nThe look of realization on her face as I closed the door made the last 5 years a complete waste of time from what I saw. I feel guilty for kicking her out of the house, for abandoning her to a certain degree since I took care of her, prepared the bed for her when she was tired from work, made sure her medicine got picked up on time. Sorted ever pill and reminded her when she forgot to take it. Everything was going well and her medicine helped her feel like herself, like she could function and not worry about \"losing\" it so to speak. I still feel bad for kicking her out and her son.  I did my best to instill discipline in her son, to be self reliant, to know when things were not ok since his dad cut off all contact with him.\n\nEven now I still feel guilty and dealing with her through the divorce is hard, as I can see her mental health declining. I was not wrong in doing this right? I just want to know that even though I feel like this, that I am not an asshole for kicking her out.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6tnuj/aita_for_kicking_my_wife_out_of_the_house/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6tnuj/aita_for_kicking_my_wife_out_of_the_house/","score":12,"num_comments":24,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764117585.0,"edited":1764118685.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
{"id":"1p6ma12","name":"t3_1p6ma12","subreddit":"AITAH","author":"Altruistic_Pea_8112","title":"AITAH for refusing large financial gift from my partner’s parents for our house?","selftext":"Hi all,\nI (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) are in the process of trying to buy our first home together. We’re both hard workers, we’ve saved a lot, and we’re trying to do this the right way.\n\nRecently, his parents offered us a large amount of money toward the house deposit — enough that it would make things much easier for us and speed up the process significantly.\n\nHere’s the issue: I don’t feel comfortable accepting it. At all.\n\nAnd it’s not because I’m proud or don’t appreciate the gesture. It’s because of who the money is coming from and the emotional strings I know I would personally feel attached to it.\n\nMy boyfriend’s dad is… complicated. He’s extremely tight with money, very “calculating,” and not what I’d describe as naturally generous. He’s the kind of person who notices every penny and has strong opinions about how others spend theirs. I don’t dislike him, but I don’t trust that a gift of this size would come without expectations — spoken or unspoken.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn’t see the issue and says I’m “making life harder for myself” by refusing. But the truth is, I know how I am. If we took this money:\n\t•\tI would feel indebted, even if no one said anything.\n\t•\tI would feel awkward in my own home when they visited.\n\t•\tI would constantly worry that decisions about the house would be judged or questioned.\n\t•\tI would feel like I owed them something, and I hate that dynamic.\n\nI grew up with the belief that your home should be the one place where you don’t owe anyone anything. I don’t want to live with the feeling that someone else has partial ownership or leverage — especially someone who already has a reputation for being controlling with it.\n\nMy boyfriend doesn’t understand because he’s used to his parents. He has no issue taking money from them. But he also wouldn’t experience the emotional discomfort I would. He said he doesn’t get why I’m making this a “big deal,” and that makes me feel even more isolated.\n\nI don’t want to offend his family. I’m not ungrateful. I just want to protect my peace and the emotional boundaries I know I need to feel safe in my own home.\n\nSo I’m stuck between:\n\t•\taccepting the money and hating the feeling of owing them\n\t•\tor sticking to my boundary and slowing down the house-buying process\n\nI’d rather take longer to get the house and know it’s ours, not tied to anyone else. But am I being unreasonable? Has anyone else dealt with this dynamic? AITAH??\n\nTLDR: Boyfriend’s dad is mean with money, yet he suddenly wants to give a big financial gift for house. Previously known to hold money over people - not sure whether to accept and just bite the bullet? \n\n\nExtra info: \n\nHey, we are already well on track to save a 20% deposit on a 550k house within the next year, £20k for stamp duty, £25k for furnishing and flooring etc, 10k financial cushion. Living costs are all very realistic and our lifestyles would allow us to go on a few holidays per year, having everything we want etc. so we don’t ’need it’s as such!\n\nThe only compromise I can think of is my partner takes the money and puts it in a savings account, and we go into the purchase on a 50/50 deposit and monthly payment basis. \n\nWe plan to pay into a joint account for mortgage and bills based on earnings (higher earner pays proportionate amount to earnings, as does lower earner), but whatever is left over goes into our own individual savings/spending accounts. We will be drawing up a contract with a solicitor to say that should we break up, we get our original deposits back and 50/50 on the house.

English isn't my first language so pardon any mistakes.\n\nOkay so buckle up. Pretty much all through my highschool and even after graduating in 2018 l was (still am kinda) part of a friend group consisting of 4 guys (\"Max\" \"Jack\" \"Ben\" \"Luke\") and 3 girls ( \"Sara\" \"May\" me) (everyone is 24/25 as of today).\n\nMay, Sara, Jack, and l were friends since middle school (actually me and Sara go even further) and in our sophomore year Max, Ben and Luke (the latter were best friends since childhood) got integrated into the group.\n\nTo cut to the chase-- Ben and I dated in our junior/senior year for roughly an year after crushing on each other quite hard earlier and getting relentlessly teased by the group. But shortly before our final year midterms he cheated on me with another girl from our school. It hurt ofc when it all came to light (the other girl told me), and l did have some unsavory moments but l got over it pretty quickly. I was never hostile to Ben and though we weren't as close anymore we still interacted normally, even joked around and did each other favors and stuff, so the group was still intact. For our friends, some were furious at Ben, others disappointed but l think seeing me \"being over it\" the whole thing kinda fizzled out.\n\nDuring covid l grew a bit more distant from everyone but May and Sara. Around 2022 we all reconnected again at May's hot pot party and we still have group hangouts sometimes. I would like to mention around this time May started dating Max and they are still dating today, a very cute couple.\n\nBen and l--- ofc when the whole group reconnected so did we. We would casually joke around and trade work/internship stories. In the beginning there was some mild flirtation which l quickly put an end to because l really don't want to focus on romance at the moment (I have only dated 2 guys short term after Ben) and even if l were to seek that l wouldnt seek the ex who cheated on me (granted people can change but l am afraid to take the risk of  waking up one day in my 30s with kids and find myself in the same position). We never really addressed those feelings. As of present we are still cordial but not close.\n\nComing to present, 3 years later. I noticed sometime around August of this year, Max and Luke would try to hint Ben likes me and l should give \"us\" a try again. The first few times l was confused but then l politely asked them to stop. Luke did Max didnt. Actually he didn't like my rejection cause he changed his tone and became more assertive. Constant hints. Apparently Ben is harboring a crush on me. I am too tired to ask him and honestly l dont have the energy in me to care. I would just rather ignore  it.\n\nBut whatever this whole \"wingmanning\" got so much worse at the end of Oct. Heard from May that Ben and Max are super close again hence the effort. Well when l tried being unresponsive it got on Max's nerves and he began messaging me all sorts of mean stuff such as I need to bring my head back to Earth, I am still salty over what happened 7 years ago, I am being a bitch.\n\nNow l was already going through a brutal 2 weeks at work and my emotions were (still are) super heightened because l can't even visit my home country with my family for christmas this year (due to some conflicting schedules). Moreover l am also completing a minor degree on the side so I am STRESSED. I was already so fucking tired l blocked him.\n\nNext thing l know May is mad at me for blocking her boyfriend. Wont let me explain myself properly. Actually took his side and reaffirmed some of the things he said. This blocking fiasco took place last saturday btw.

We were both in grad school and used to study together virtually. It was mostly academic support, but we built a routine and stayed in touch long after. But over the years, I felt our “friendship” became incredibly one-sided.\n\n**For context:** \n\nLeena is the kind of person who brings gifts for everyone when she visits, and she’s charismatic and well-meaning, when she receive her friends, she prepare the space really nicely so they feel welcome. But she also has a long-running pattern of instability that’s been really hard to watch and even harder to support.\n\nShe has a complicated family background. Though she grew up with money, her home life wasn’t emotionally stable. Her mother struggled with mental health, and her father was emotionally distant. She no longer has contact with him, even though I’ve encouraged her to reconnect. She says he has hurt her in the past, and \"dead to her.\" She also has abandonment issues, which she’s shared openly to me.\n\nOver the past few years, she’s gone through constant housing issues. Some of it is justified (she’s had to deal with slumlords), but she also insists on living in extremely expensive areas, and often overextends herself financially. She’s burned bridges with landlords, roommates, and even friends, usually over control issues or expectations around how things should be. She rarely lasts long in any living situation before something goes wrong. I’ve tried to be sensitive to her situations.\n\nAt one point, my parents let her live at their house for months when she was in a bind. While there, she took over a whole room for her business, frequently complained about conditions (even though she was staying rent-free), and created tension in the house. She means well, but living with her is not the same as having her visit for a few hours. Eventually, my dad asked her to leave, it was too much, she ended up going to return to finish school abroad. Though, my parents always maintained a connection with her and told her “she is family”.\n\nDespite all this, I’ve helped her again and again. I’ve lent her thousands of dollars for rent, deposits, and even legal help when a rash decision led to trouble. I helped her set up an apartment, supported her emotionally, and even lived with her once for about six weeks while I was working in her area. I’ve seen the good sides of her, too.\n\nFast forward to last week: she messaged one of my parents saying she was “coming Tuesday” to visit for Thanksgiving. That was it. No mention of how long she’d be staying, whether she needed to stay over, or anything. My parents, already prepping that room for a different relative, and other family members are coming home, so they became concerned and asked me to clarify her plans.\n\nThis is what unfolded in our text message conversation last weekend:\n\n>**Me:** *“Oh, by the way, mom and dad were asking if you were thinking on staying the day that you visit.”*\n\n>**Leena:** *“What do you mean? I thought you already told them I was coming from for Thanksgiving and I did too. I wasn’t planning on staying anywhere else.”*\n\n>**Me:** *“They asked me how long were you planning to stay because they had to fix the room for a cousin. He is moving home, because he terminated contract in his current job, and has to give his apartment back. I think he us returning along the same time.*\n\n>*You should meet him. He likes doing bussiness stuff.* 😇\\*”\\*\n\n>**Leena:** *“I was planning on staying from Tuesday to Saturday, but if they don’t want me to come please let me know.”*\n\n>**Me:** *“On the contrary, they are delighted! Is just they want to plan out. I’ll tell them, because I think they were not clear when you spoke to them. (Remember sometimes they don’t understand things and they feel shy to clarify).*\n\n>*Bro, Idk I noticed that is a latino trait in general. They just nod, even if they don’t understand.”*\n\n**At this point, I thought my parents and her went through all of this in a call. Later, they told me it was just a text message. BTW, me and my family are from another culture and my parents don't speak proficient English. This year my parents are celebrating Thanksgiving somewhere else. I work at another city, and I wasn't sure if I could even go home, because I might have to cover shifts on Friday and Saturday.**\n\n>**Leena:** *“This is making me feel like they don’t want me. We’ve had holiday issues in the past, and you know how things have been with my own family, so I really do need to feel expressly invited. You told me that I’m always invited so I worked under that assumption this year, even though I like to be expressly invited. When the room was brought up in the context of someone else needing it, it hit me in that same familiar place and made me feel really unwelcome, even if that wasn’t what they meant.”*\n\n>**Me:** *“Why would you think that they don’t want you there? They’re more than happy to happy home. In terms of the Thanksgiving dinner this year we will not be having Thanksgiving dinner. They’re actually going to a relative's house. And I’m not going to Thanksgiving this year. I’ll have to stay.* 😕\n\n>*they are really happy to have you visit, but I don’t know if you spoke about Thanksgiving dinner?*\n\n>*If you want to go to the dinner, I think you can't bring your service animal because our relative has an untrained pet at her house, which is a bummer. The other option is you can come to my city. I don’t mind.*\n\n>*But we will have to find you a place to stay nearby. How are you coming to my parents house? Are you driving?*\n\n>*I do have to go to work. They have not handed our schedule yet.”*\n\n>**Leena:** *“Listen, this is really hurting my feelings. I was just trying to see my family and now I feel incredibly unwelcome. I’m going to have to take some time to respond. I’m not really in a place where I can put my feelings together right now.”*\n\n>**Me:** *“Ok. I am sorry, that was not anyones intention. I have to clarify their plans too. I understand you I bummed out because it is a different Thanksgiving for me.”*\n\n**This interaction left me feeling uneasy, I felt emotionally manipulated, and honestly I'm tired of walking on eggshells just to make her comfortable. So 2 days later I decided to express my feelings about the whole interaction.**\n\n>**Me:** *“I need to be honest with you — this whole situation left me feeling really hurt, confused, and drained.*\n\n>*I spoke to my parents, and they told me they never actually had a full conversation with you about Thanksgiving. You sent a message to dad, but he never replied, and from what I understood, there was no clear plan. I thought you had spoken to them and confirmed. But it turns out you made plans based on what worked best for you — not on what was actually discussed with them.*\n\n>That’s not fair to them, and honestly, it’s not fair to me either.\n\n>I understand your living situation is tough and that holidays bring up a lot for you — I really do. But when I asked a basic logistics question, just trying to understand what you were planning and how everything would fit with what was happening in the house, your immediate response was:\n\n>“If they don’t want me to come, please let me know.”\n\n>*That shifted the energy instantly. What could have been a simple clarification suddenly became loaded, emotional, and heavy. It put me into a corner where any attempt to clarify felt like I was rejecting you. It made asking for basic information feel like an accusation or an attack.*\n\n>*That’s not communication. That’s emotional deflection — turning a neutral question into a test of loyalty or affection.*\n\n>*And I have to be real with you: it honestly felt like you were planning to use our home as a crash pad while sorting things out, without directly communicating with the people whose home it is. Maybe that wasn’t your intention, but the impact matters. You weren’t just planning a visit — you were relying on other people’s resources, space, and flexibility without coordinating with them first.*\n\n>*And here’s the part that really hurt:*\n\n>*Even I, as their daughter, do not treat my parents’ house that way. I don’t make plans around their home without speaking to them directly. I don’t assume availability or expect them to rearrange their space or schedule for me. So, for you to do that — and then respond with hurt when someone asked a clarifying question — felt unfair and, honestly, disrespectful.*\n\n>*I know you’ve been through a lot, and your feelings are valid. But valid feelings don’t give anyone a pass to override boundaries or skip clear communication. I’ve supported you emotionally, logistically, and financially, and I’ve done so without making it about me. But when I finally needed clarity and space, the situation instantly revolved around your pain and fear of rejection instead of the actual issue being discussed.*\n\n>*That’s the pattern I’m done with.*\n\n>*Whenever I express a limit, ask a question, or try to clarify something, the focus shifts to your emotions, your past, your hurt — and suddenly I’m the one being unkind or insensitive. That dynamic is exhausting, and I can’t keep carrying the emotional weight for both of us.*\n\n>*I’m not trying to push you away. I care about you. But I cannot keep holding space for your needs while mine get swallowed under guilt and emotional pressure.*\n\n>*Going forward, I need mutual responsibility — in communication, in emotional reactions, and in the way we make plans. If you’re hurt, say so — but don’t turn that hurt into blame. If you’re unsure, ask — don’t assume. And if you need something, express it directly — don’t expect others to read your mind or rearrange their lives based on unspoken expectations.”*\n\n>\n\n>**Leena:** *“It’s really hurtful to be accused of using anyone as a crash pad when all I was doing was trying to see my family. You told me before to assume I’m invited, so I did that, but it sounds like you’re saying I shouldn’t anymore. I wasn’t trying to use anyone or take advantage of anything — I just wanted to be with my family for Thanksgiving. I’ve been trying to coordinate Thanksgiving for the past week. I was waiting on you to tell me what days you were going and I was lining up with that. You’ve made a kind visit where I was just trying to see my family into something where I’m using resources and that’s very hurtful. I’m sorry that you’re upset. You’re assuming the worst about me and that’s just not nice at all.* \n\n>*I was trying to plan a normal visit and you turned it into something where I was using people. I literally said let me know if they don’t want me to come because I literally did not want to impose. I’m allowed to have hurt feelings and you are too.*\n\n>*It’s sad that you assume the worst of me. I don’t need anyone for anything and I didn’t ask anyone for anything. I was just trying to visit my family. I don’t understand how your family dynamic work, but you literally told me to assume that I was invited so I did that this year but clearly that wasn’t the way to go. I don’t know how this works. I’m just a human being. But it’s pretty bad that you’re automatically gonna assume some terrible ulterior motive from me when I literally was trying to visit you and your parents for a holiday. I was trying to plan a normal visit and you turned it into something where I was using people. I literally said let me know if they don’t want me to come because I literally did not want to impose. I’m allowed to have hurt feelings and you are too.*\n\n>*It’s sad that you assume the worst of me. I don’t need anyone for anything and I didn’t ask anyone for anything. I was just trying to visit my family. I don’t understand how your family dynamic work, but you literally told me to assume that I was invited so I did that this year but clearly that wasn’t the way to go. I don’t know how this works. I’m just a human being. But it’s pretty bad that you’re automatically gonna assume some terrible ulterior motive from me when I literally was trying to visit you and your parents for a holiday.*\n\n>*Bringing my housing situation into this is really low and completely unfair. I will be telling you a lot less about my life in the future. You literally took a very brief situation and just weaponized it against me. That’s really low. And had nothing to do with Thanksgiving at all.”*\n\n>**Me:** *“Leena, I need you to understand something clearly. I asked a straightforward logistics question, and you turned it into an emotional narrative about rejection. That shift is exactly the problem. You keep flipping my words into an attack when they were never meant that way, and it’s not fair.*\n\n>*Your past experiences and family scars are real, but they are yours to manage. They are not mine to absorb or fix. When every practical conversation becomes about your hurt or your trauma, it turns into a way of avoiding responsibility instead of dealing with what actually happened.*\n\n>*Here are the facts:*\n\n>*– You did not communicate your plans clearly.*\n\n>*– Nothing was confirmed with my parents.*\n\n>*– One vague, unanswered message is not coordination.*\n\n>*– I asked a basic question.*\n\n>*– You turned it into rejection, hurt, and guilt.*\n\n>*That is the pattern I’m calling out.*\n\n>*You keep saying I’m assuming the worst of you, but what’s actually happening is that you're avoiding owning your part by centering everything around your pain. That ends up being unkind and disrespectful to me, whether you intended it or not — and it did hurt me.*\n\n>*My message was not an attack. It was me explaining how I felt.*\n\n>*And my feelings matter, too.*\n\n>*My boundaries matter, too.*\n\n>*My perspective matters, too.*\n\n>*Your feelings do not cancel mine out.*\n\n>*Your hurt does not erase the impact of your words or the lack of communication.*\n\n>*And your trauma is not my responsibility to carry.*\n\n>*I’m tired of being put in the position of managing your emotions or being guilt-tripped whenever I bring up something real. I am done absorbing emotional weight that does not belong to me.*\n\n>*If this friendship is going to continue, there has to be space for both of our feelings — not just yours. There has to be accountability, not narrative-spinning. If you cannot recognize how your reactions have hurt me, or if my feelings only matter when they don’t inconvenience you, then this is not a friendship I can continue.*\n\n>*What happens next is up to you.”*\n\n>\n\n>**Leena:** *“You’re allowed to have your emotions and your perspective, and I’m not trying to cancel them out. But the way you’re framing this doesn’t match what actually happened. I wasn’t turning anything into rejection or guilt — I was trying to clarify plans, and your response went far beyond what I said or intended. I’m not going to absorb motives or narratives that don’t belong to me, and I’m not going to take responsibility for interpretations I didn’t create. I care about you, but this went somewhere unfair and hurtful, and there has to be room for my feelings too. You get to have your feelings and I get to have mine. I would never accuse you of what you accuse me of today and that’s really nasty. What you said to me today was very nasty and I’m allowed to be upset by that. Clarifying simple dates should not have turned into a character assassination. You did that not me. You get to have your feelings and I get to have mine. And I should have a best friend that doesn’t assume the worst about me because what you assumed today was very nasty and not true. I’m very sad that you’re acting this way. I will always make room for your feelings and you can always say how you feel. When it moves to assuming things about my motives or my character, then I get to step in and say you are incorrect.”*\n\n>\n\n**I decided to leave not respond, because at this point we were going in circles. Later on, she texted my parents again, asking if it was okay for her to visit on Tuesday for Thanksgiving.

It’s a three–story building where each floor is an apartment. My grandparents live on the first floor, we live on the third, and the second floor is empty.\n\nMy dad has three sisters. One of them—let’s call her Aunt M—is divorced and has a 40-year-old son who is jobless and does nothing except spend his mother’s money. Whenever she doesn’t give him money (or enough), he throws a tantrum—screaming, breaking things, causing chaos. Since Aunt M usually stays with my grandparents, I grew up hearing this all the time. Thankfully, this past year had been peaceful because Aunt M sent him overseas.\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\nAbout a week ago, my mom was on a trip with her friend, so it was just my dad and me at home. When I came back from work, I noticed the main door of the building was double-locked, which we don’t usually do. As I passed my grandparents’ apartment, I saw no one inside, so I assumed they were out visiting someone. I went upstairs to our place on the third floor.\n\nFast forward to midnight. As I was trying to fall asleep, I suddenly heard the main door being violently hit. Then I heard my cousin’s voice yelling for Aunt M. I immediately understood: he came looking for her—who wasn’t even in the house—to get money or whatever he wanted.\n\nI went to my dad’s room to tell him what was happening so he could call Aunt M and sort it out. He didn’t open the door and just told me to “ignore it and pretend we’re not here.”\n\nMeanwhile, my cousin kept hitting the door harder and harder. At some point, he even managed to unlock the first lock (thank God it was double-locked). Then he started throwing rocks toward the window of the first-floor room where his mother usually sleeps. It was terrifying.\n\nInside our apartment, everything was completely dark because my dad forbid me from turning on any lights or even speaking loudly—he didn’t want my cousin to notice we were inside (which made the whole thing feel even worse and more absurd).\n\nI tried to “ignore it,” but there was no way I could sleep with a grown 40-year-old man attacking the house. Exhausted and frustrated, I went back to my dad’s room to beg him to do something. He refused again and told me I was being overdramatic and needed to “man up.”\n\nI told him that as long as my cousin was in town, I wouldn’t stay in that house and that the next day I would go stay at my grandmother’s (my mom’s side). Thankfully, my cousin eventually left after a neighbor yelled at him from their window to go away.\n\nThe next day, I called my mom—who was coming back from her trip that night—and told her everything. She also didn’t want to return to the house after hearing what happened, so she said she would stay with me at my grandmother’s. My dad was very upset. He said we were being dramatic and abandoning him, which turned into a huge argument between my parents. It escalated to the point where my dad told my mom they should end things.\n\nRight now, we’re still staying at my grandma’s. My dad has called me several times, telling me I’m a crybaby and that *I* am the main reason everything blew up and why the family is in this situation.\n\nAt first I was angry at him, but after those calls, I’ve started feeling guilty.\n\n**AITAH?**","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p68jxl/aitah_for_telling_my_father_that_i_wont_stay_at/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p68jxl/aitah_for_telling_my_father_that_i_wont_stay_at/","score":9,"num_comments":14,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764064520.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I 22F  mixed with Sicilian (mom’s side) and black. I grew up with my mom’s side of the family my whole life. My grandparents are straight from Sicily, very old school and they expect everyone to stick to the same family values. My mom had me at 18 and got kicked out for getting pregnant by a black guy and also because of how young she was. I ended up being raised by my grandparents and I love my grandmom to death! However, certain people on that side of the family used to talk about my appearance at a very young age. My hair being way too curly, lips being too big, legs too wide. Butt too big. You get it. As I’ve gotten older, I realized how wrong that was and that’s probably the reason why I grew up very insecure from a very young age. \n\nFast forward, I had a baby boy at 21 and yes my boyfriend is black. I was too scared to ever bring him around because I knew how my grandfather is. Even though he has accepted me and his other mixed grandchildren, doesn’t mean he’s gonna accept some “random” guy. I knew this because he would always make slick remarks to my mom’s boyfriends and that they like chicken or watermelon. He would also tease my mom’s boyfriend because he didn’t eat pork, religious reasoning. \n\nAnyway, 6 months pregnant, finally see my grandfather, grandmas in Sicily visiting her mom who’s sick. He seemed excited, told me it was okay, and that he loved me either way. Mind you, he didn’t meet my boyfriend yet and didn’t know what he looked like. When my boyfriend finally came from Sunday dinner, he looks and says “this is the guy?”. I knew what he meant… \n\nIt’s been a year since my son has been born, grandfathers still always saying something about my boyfriend when we have these occasional dinners. But he won’t say it to him, he’ll say it to my uncle in Sicilian, knowing damn well I can understand everything he’s saying. He just never knew I was listening. He even made the watermelon “joke” to my boyfriend. He seems to only talk to my uncle and his wife who is white, so I think that’s why he respects them so much? Not sure. He doesn’t even have conversations with my mom, his own daughter. FUNNY!!!\n\nWe went to celebrate my son’s first birthday at the grandparents house today. I love seeing my grandmom but when he comes in the house, it’s like everything becomes very uncomfortable. He first confronts my boyfriend for not answering the phone a couple weeks, but I told him not to answer. My mom wasn’t going to the dinner so I sure wasn’t neither. They don’t take no for an answer so I just didn’t answer. I know very childish of me but whatever. I tried to tell him it was my fault but he cut me off and proceeds. My grandmom whispers and tells me it’s okay and to ignore him. \n\nNow it’s time to sing happy birthday. My mom is on a zoom call with my sisters doctor, my cousin and brother are nowhere to be found. I told them to wait for them and that I definitely wanted my mom to be in pictures. I told everyone what my mom was doing and of course grandfather says I’m lying and who gets on a zoom call at 7pm.. so they just start singing. Candles not lit. Everyone’s not in the room. Why would I want my son’s first birthday to go like this?? They cut the cake and I storm off. My grandmom goes crazy, yelling at my grandfather saying it’s all his fault and to shut his mouth sometimes. Grandfather and his mom start ganging up on my grandmom the way they’ve done her whole life smh. I come back and we start arguing. I told him I know he doesn’t like my boyfriend because he’s black. He doesn’t accept him nor does he accept my son. He starts pointing his finger in my face calling me a liar and a bad person. I take all my belongings and we leave. Of course I left my phone so my boyfriend goes in there looking for it. My grandfather tells my boyfriend that’s he’s not a racist ANYMORE. My boyfriend just wanted to explain how I felt but again cut him off and told him to get out his house. I don’t plan on going back over there.

My two roommates went on a trip with him to a wine festival (I was not on this trip) and he quickly became belligerently drunk and hit on (F23) roommate. When she turned him down he became incredibly defensive and tried to argue with her saying he saw a future with her (they had met 2 weeks prior) and that there were mixed signals. While this was happening roommate (F25) had gone off with a boy willingly but had clearly stated she did not want to go home with anyone that night. When roommate (F23) tried to go to find her and make sure things were going well he tried to stop her and said that by going off with that man roomate (F25) had already consented to anything that would happen that night.\n\nAlready a rough start but we tried to move on because it is a small program and we had already made plans for another week long trip with him and it felt rude to cut him out. The night we were supposed to leave for the week long trip he got drunk again and hit on a different classmate with the exact same awkward moves he did to roommate (F23) when she rejected him he came back to the residence and started acting super weird like staring through our window watching my two roommates without saying anything and telling me I should have told him she was queer. (She later told us that after he rejected him he started monologuing about all his failed relationships with women including including roommate F23).\n\nOn the trip he wasn’t terrible just a very annoying travel partner. He was constantly late and wouldn’t carry cash so I was constantly covering him. He was also decidedly unhelpful and would do little put downs on my navigation or planning without offering to do anything constructive.\n\nSince we got back there’s been a build up small and not so small things. For starters he won’t leave roommate (F23) alone he follows her at run club, stalks all her social media and just lingers behind her in group settings. He picks very weird arguments to engage with like how the gender pay gap isn’t real and how women need to go 50/50 in relationships (regardless if any of this is true why are you picking these fights with women?). Overall he is just not a person any of us feel comfortable hanging out with outside of the classroom.\n\nHere’s where it gets tricky. Way back before all this happened we decided to go to the Olympics and he bought the tickets. Point blank we will not be going with him, roommate (F23) is obviously not comfortable around him and it feels diabolical and disingenuous to keep hanging out with him and acting like everything is fine when we all don’t have a good opinion of him. We are booking our accommodations and I’m wondering WIBTA if we directly told him we would like to keep our interactions to the classroom and offered to buy his ticket from him.\n\nPlease help this feels like high school drama as a grown adults and the thought of how it will make him feel is giving me heart palpitations.

(she is still one of my closest friends) \n\nin may of this year her and i took a trip and went to a concert and she posted a picture of the back of our heads to her instagram story and not even 5 minutes after that was posted i get a text from my brother with a screenshot of the story saying “are you fucking hanging out with bri again?”\n\ni responded standing up for myself and explained in depth that we had met up and cleared up our misunderstanding and that we were chill again. and he proceeded to say stuff like “i cant believe you’d hang out with her again. we all agreed she was crazy.” (which i may have said some mean stuff when i was upset with her but we literally cleared all of that up)\n\nhe never replied to my response and about a week later he just texted “call me when you can.” and i proceeded to just not call lol\n\nwe haven’t spoken since and both he, his wife and all of her siblings, as well as our mutual best friend have unfollowed me on social media. \n\ni’ve reached out to the mutual friend and he said he was proud of me for standing up for myself but that he didn’t feel like he could choose between me and my brother (which he technically did because he stopped talking to me other than this conversation?) \n\nbut that’s pretty much it. there’s some more personal stuff that i’ve left out for obvious reasons but that’s the gist of it. i just can’t decide if im overreacting and would love input or advice\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6ozee/am_i_the_asshole_for_going_no_contact_with_my/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6ozee/am_i_the_asshole_for_going_no_contact_with_my/","score":7,"num_comments":11,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764105854.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I lived away from my parents as I already have a family of my own. My brother also lives with his family away from our parents’ house (they have no kids). Now my brother put up an office near my parents’ house to save rent on land and maybe to see my parents everyday too. My parents told me a few months ago that my brother is having an extra marital affair with his secretary in his office and the woman was caught leaving his private room. My mom confronted her and she was unable to speak. My parents tried to solve it and told my brother to fire her. Otherwise, he has to leave.

{"id":"1p6pd4s","name":"t3_1p6pd4s","subreddit":"AITAH","author":"Mental_Fennel2873","title":"AITA for realizing I am basically dating a man-child with an actual child?","selftext":"I(25F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for almost two years. We moved in together pretty fast (around 9 months in), and the beginning was rough. Lots of fighting, lots of “should we even be together?” conversations. Things have been better lately, but I still find myself replaying so many past arguments that I’m starting to question everything again.\n\nFor context: we both work full-time. I’m also a full-time student. He has a 3-year-old daughter who stays with us a couple of times a week. And somehow, I still end up being the one who handles 95% of the housework—cleaning, organizing, cooking, laundry, packing lunches, everything. I do it because that’s how I show love, not because he asks. But when I’m exhausted and ask for help, I usually get sarcasm, jokes, or “you can make me a list.”\n\nHe’ll tell me I’m “a hard fish to catch” and that he appreciates everything I do, but then he’ll turn around and say I don’t show him enough affection. It’s hard to feel affectionate when I’m drowning in responsibilities and he’s offering commentary instead of support.\n\nWhen his daughter is over, I’m usually the one playing with her, chasing her around, keeping her out of things she shouldn’t be touching. Meanwhile, he’s scrolling on TikTok or doing random things around the house. I genuinely love spending time with her, but it feels like I’m the one actually engaging and in reality its not my child.\n\nThen there’s the part where he’s out with his friends 3–4 days a week after work. I don’t care that he has a social life—if anything, I think it’s healthy. What bothers me is how he has endless energy for them but comes home drained when it comes to me. Example: last week, I asked him for laundry detergent on his way home. It’s literally a 5–10 minute detour. He said yes… then came home empty-handed because he was “too tired.” Mind you, he had driven 20–30 minutes earlier that same night to go hang out with his friends. So somehow they get the energy but I don’t?\n\nWe’ve also argued about partying. I’ve told him I’m not comfortable dating someone who drinks/clubs/parties all the time. He usually agrees, but during a fight he threw out, “Why can’t I live my life like you did in college?” First of all, we didn’t know each other then. Second, I’ve never once weaponized the fact that he had a kid at 20. He’s the one comparing our lives. Our life stages weren’t even remotely similar.\n\nHe also claims I “never see his side,” even though I try. Meanwhile, he avoids acknowledging that being a dad comes with actual responsibilities. And being a partner—at any age—means including your person, not shutting them out or prioritizing everyone else by default.\n\nThis has all gotten so overwhelming that I actually started overthinking whether he might be cheating—not because I have proof, but because the emotional distance is getting to me. He says his phone is “an open book,” but that hasn’t stopped the anxiety. I’m literally getting an STD test today just to calm my own mind and stop spiraling.\n\nSo now I’m stuck wondering if I’m the problem… or if he just isn’t ready to live the life he already has. I don’t think I’m asking for much: effort, partnership, basic presence. But he’s acting like a single guy with no obligations, not someone with a daughter or a long-term partner.\n\nAITA for being upset and feeling like he needs to step up, and wanting to humble him? Am I being controlling ? \n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6pd4s/aita_for_realizing_i_am_basically_dating_a/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6pd4s/aita_for_realizing_i_am_basically_dating_a/","score":6,"num_comments":38,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764106750.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

My niece is 10 and an only child so it would be great to give her some company. \n\nOne random day, Sister #2 came across a post from a friend selling her 6mo old toy poodle because the owner is moving out of our city. Within the hour, she was already discussing payments with the previous owner and talking about it with Sister #1. \n\nI got annoyed and anxious bc I have never had a pet before, so I know nothing about dogs. Also 2 days after the puppy came home, Sister #2 had to go on a work trip for a week, leaving me and my roommate to take care of this puppy. It’s great for her because I’m unemployed right now due to a life-threatening medical emergency (physically unfit to perform duties). So I’m home all the time. And my roommate works. So I’m taking care of the puppy the majority of the time involuntarily.\n\nAt first when this puppy came, it was hell. First of all, I fucking hate the previous owners. They said he’s potty trained, knows commands, etc… BULLSHIT. This puppy pisses and shits everywhere. He doesn’t listen to anything. Gets distracted. Anxious. Bites. Eats stuff. On walks, he runs everywhere and jumps on people. We already had to take him to the vet, that’s $ we can’t give all the time!\n\nThese previous owners clearly neglected him. During her work trip I had to teach a 6mo old how to do everything. I dont have a job rn but I spent some of my last $ on dog food and cleaning supplies. My apt smells and I’m drowning everything in odor eliminators. Im tired and fucking annoyed. And the puppy was supposed to be here until after Thanksgiving to go home with Sister #1 and my niece. They don’t live in the same city as us, and they’re coming to my house this week so we planned on surprising my niece with the puppy. One prob: Sister #1’s apt has policies that have a 90% chance of not allowing her to have a puppy in her home unless it’s for mental reasons or if she moves. So now, Sister #2 is deciding to KEEP the puppy. \n\nNot only this responsibility has been thrown on me indefinitely, when she came back from her trip she’s been insufferable. I cannot tell Sister #2 ANYTHING. Everything I say it ends up in fights bc I “complain too much” or “being mean to the dog”… all bc I give her heads-up on the dog’s actions.

If I shoo the puppy away from chewing shoes or not enable bad puppy behaviors or try to enforce routine IM NOT BEING FUCKING MEAN.\n\nThis is the most annoying month of my fucking life.

I bought a pair of Steve Madden cobras which are basically giant platforms that give me 5 inches more of height. I excitedly wore them on a first date because -new shoes!  I didn't know the guy's height beforehand, just didn't think about it. He turned out to be about 5'9\" as well, a normal, average height for a man in the US. Obviously my shoes made me 6'2\". He did comment on how tall the shoes I wore made me and made a joke about people thinking he was my kid. The date went fine but after he sent me a text saying that the shoes I wore made him feel insulted because it was \"emasculating\" that I made him look small and he wasn't comfortable. That certainly wasn't my intention. I just wanted to wear my fun new shoes because they made me feel good. Some friends say he was being insecure and ridiculous, while others say I shouldn't have worn them on a first date because they're \"too much\" and guys don't like really tall women. I feel like I should just be who I am right off the bat when dating.

Both of my sisters have disabilities. Hayley has high functioning Asperger's Syndrome, and Morgan has Autism as well as severe intellectual disabilities, leaving her functioning at about a 5-6 year old. Because of this, I have had to grow up very fast and take on a parental-like role, even going as far as aiding in discipline and cleaning her private parts. \n\nBecause of her disability, Morgan can get aggressive sometimes. She also screams at the top of her lungs and bangs on whatever furniture she can. The house is VERY tense because of this. She is also not toilet trained (part of her disability). Imagine wiping your sibling's private parts, ESPECIALLY when she's on her period. Another thing she will do is nag you over and over to sing a certain song or recite things from her favorite tv shows and movies (that's the only way she plays) to the point where you are about to explode. But of course, with the nagging and misbehavior, I don't want to play with her. But if you refuse, where does that leave you? With more screaming and banging. This has taken a real toll on my mental health. \n\nHaley is lazy. While she does have some mental health challenges, she does not have a job (nor is she looking), and is basically a freeloader by choice. She does the dishes and laundry to make her rent because she doesn't have a job, but she is constantly behind or just flat out doesn't do it some days because she doesn't feel like it. She does nothing to help around the house unless specifically told/asked to (she has gotten better but it's still not where it should be) and is very immature. I find myself constantly having to do things for her. In addition, I do not have any friends I can talk to about this other than my boyfriend because Haley consistently inserts herself into all of my activities and becomes friends with my friends too. \n\nAfter years of this, I just can't help but feel resentment towards my sisters. Morgan for the aggression (and the toll it takes on my mental health) and the responsibilities I should have never had. Haley because of the freeloading and for her history of leaving the load of our other sister on me. There's more I haven't mentioned, but if I mentioned everything that goes on, we would be here all day. And this has really taken a toll on my mental health to the point where I get depressed sometimes, I'm short with my family, I often want to just run away, and the smallest inconvenience feels like the biggest thing in the world. But I can't help but feel like an awful sister for feeling this way over something that is out of everyone's control. So Reddit, AITA for feeling resentment towards my sisters with disabilities?\n\nEDIT: My parents are also in the picture and they carry all the responsibilities that I have, plus things like paying bills, cleaning the house, making dinner, etc. It's not like they aren't doing their part and I apologize if I did not make that clear. They try to reduce the amount of responsibilities I have, but with so many disabilities and challenges, additional help is needed. \nAlso, I still live at home because my boyfriend and I are planning to get engaged in the spring, and we are both Catholic and don't believe in moving in with each other before marriage. So if I moved somewhere else with someone else, I would only be living elsewhere for a year or so. So I think it would be better to save for our future place and just put up with my current situation.

Recently we had a family get together and my boyfriends sister asked me if my ring was an engagement ring ( a cheap ring I put in my finger to show I’m taken when im out in public alone ) My boyfriend then speaks for me and says “No” . Wich is fine . The sister asked me if we planned on ever getting married due to us having a son already and I jumped and said “No “ very audibly . And she asked why and I said “it was a trap “ . My boyfriend then got very upset .  \n\nFor a little back reference: his family is very.. strange. His sister, we’ll call her Sam ,and her daughter who is in her mid 20’s , we’ll call her Ally , have bizzare petnames for my boyfriend . Calling. Him “ Pooh bear “ “ baby boo “ etc . They always call him when they need something : money , help , car things . And my boyfriend is very sweet and provides .  Mind you they have their own boyfriends ( his older sister Sam is divorced) . They treat him very sweetly but have this “ thing “ with me . I can’t put my finger on it yet but they are quite “ fake”. I love my boyfriend so much it makes me swoon . But I can’t ever be married to him because of his family making me feel like I simply do not belong , AITAH? \n\nI did not know this would blow up how it did : so here is more context . \nMy boyfriend lived with his older sister Sam for 8 years prior to us meeting/ dating , both his parents are out of the picture so she essentially “took him in” . From the beginning they are all.. very close. Legs touching when sitting in the couch/ sharing a blanket share food and drinks from the same cup , Sam always wants my boyfriend to message her legs back ( she’s only 39 ) , She also openly talks about her sex life quiet graphically infront of her adult children and my boyfriend … I came from a family that was NOT touchy feely or maybe that affectionate or so OPEN about such topics ..so it could be just me . Other that if they just make me feel awkward : inside jokes I’m obviously not apart of, they still talk to my boyfriend ex girlfriend and she comes over to the sister Sam’s house regularly wich bothers me because my boyfriend goes over there to help his sister from time to time . They just have always made me feel like I don’t belong . And I love him so I force my self to go to  his family side gathering for our child and him . Maybe I am the asshole for being in love with him and not his family: they are terrible influences and addicts  that “ mooch “ of my boyfriend and use his super sweet kind heart as weakness. I’m starting to also realize because I put my foot down when it comes to his free labor and asking for money besides being super comfortable and affectionate towards each other …I come from a conventional mom and pop family . So marriage was pressured in me once I became pregnant . It’s 2025 and a lot of things have changed . \n\nThank you Reddit for your help.

He said he planned to spend his day off resting at home.\n\nLast night he finished work late around 8:30pm and mentioned taking part in a pub quiz.

Apologies for the long post. \n\nMy father passed away 6 years ago. I always thought growing up my parents were going to divorce at any moment. They never slept in the same bed, and they always argued and didn’t really have anything in common besides me and my older brother (37M). About two years before my father passed, my mother began dating her high school crush. She had not even separated from my father. Also during that time, my father became addicted to opioids. It started as pain from scar tissue and blew up into a full blown addiction. Once he discovered the affair, he began spiraling into a depression. Saying things to me like he can’t start over and he didn’t want to do it without her. One day while I was planning my daughter’s 2nd birthday -at a friend’s house. I get a call from my mother, frantic, telling me my dad was gone. He in every sense of the word killed himself. He stopped all his medication except the pain medication. He has thyroid problems and pretty bad diabetes. One week after he passed. She moved in her boyfriend at the time. ONE WEEK. I was upset but did not have the strength in me to fight and did not want to risk losing my other parent. After about a year she kicked him out because he was a deadbeat. She spiraled into a depression. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago, my brother and I had a falling out. (A story for another time). And I completely cut him out of my life. The toxic relationship between me and him was not going to get better. She began pushing me to make amends. When I didn’t budge, she then started in on the I’m sorry I’m a horrible mother, etc. I distanced myself from her because of that and she had started becoming unreliable for me and my kids. Promising things like sleep overs or dinners with us, then ghosting us and never having a reason. About the Monday before thanksgiving 2024, I had not heard anything plans, we usually have dinner at her house. So I reached out to ask about plans and If I needed to bring anything. She then informed me that she wasn’t having dinner at her house, my brother invited her to his and that was where she was going to be. I had no invitation no nothing. I had never cooked a thanksgiving meal before and NEVER spent it without my family. But in 3 days I had to figure it out. I made it work and we had a pretty great thanksgiving. Just our little family. \n\nFast forward to this year, my mother has a new man. He seems nice. She has started going to church and making friends in the church. So she’s been less depressed. Her and my brother had a falling out because of this new relationship. And I decided with her new outlook and positive change I would try to get our mother daughter relationship back on track. She is planning on moving in with her man, which I fully support, but that means she would be selling my childhood home. I have made it known several times I want to buy the home to raise my kids in. Also, I gave her an invitation to our thanksgiving (yes I’m cooking again lol) MONTHS in advance and she said she would be here after she went to church. \n\nThis past weekend, she was going to take my kids so that me and my fiancé could have a date night (we get one maybe once every 6 months). The day came and she didn’t answer the phone or text back, I was concerned until I saw her online on social media. I was annoyed because I just didn’t understand why she just didn’t say hey can’t do it. But we made it work and made it a family fun night instead. \n\nSo today, the Monday before thanksgiving 2025. I still had not heard anything from her so I reached out to let her know what time we were eating and what I was preparing. She has a very short conversation with me about how she bet it will be great. Blah blah blah. She THEN proceeded to text my fiancé asking if we wanted to do a date night this Friday? Also, she’s going to sell the house to her neighbor, OH and she was going to try and stop by on thanksgiving but that she was going to be with her new man and his friends. \n\nAm I over reacting? WIBTAH if I uninvited her? I’m at a loss and any advice would be greatly appreciated. \n\nAlso I hope everyone has a happy peaceful holiday❤️\n\nThank you!

Admittedly I quite enjoy NSFW roleplay and erotica writing with partners that I find on Reddit and I have been doing this for a number of years. One of the kinks however that I sometimes explore is Consensual Non Consent (sometimes involcing use of the R word.)\n\nNow, to establish right off the bat, this kink in no way defines me as a person. I believe strongly as anyone should that actual non consent, actual abuse and actual violence or harm are all of course wrong. Never have I ever wished or intended to cause any actual harm to anyone and this interest has and always will be a fictional interest that is explored with mutually consenting partners (Female if that matters).\n\none of my friends accidentally discovered my NSFW reddit account\n\nThis friend has known for some time without my knowledge and has then confided in the others in my friend group as they believe this to be immoral. They have said that he didn't initially disclose that this was my account but when others guessed that it was mine as I was the one not in the discussion they did not deny that it was mine. Now my entire friend group have learnt about my CNC kink.\n\nMy friends have then confronted me, declaring that there was a serious issue with the things that I have been posted and that I need to have a serious mental check. I stated that I did not know what they were talking about and they have then declared what they had found out. At realising that they are confronting me about my CNC kink I have panicked and stormed out and left.\n\nWhat follows is a length message exchange. Truthfully at the beginning I was very retaliatory and unkind. I accused them of being cruel, humiliating me, discussing this personal life behind my back and snooping on my personal accounts. I tried to explain that if the one person had approached me feeling uncomfortable I would have gladly discussed this with them further but my main issue has been how they have appeared to have discussed this as a friend group and collectively decided that I am a bed person without any chance for me to defend myself.\n\nI really don't know where to stand on this. I've tried to explain that I do not endorse actual non consent, that everything is fully consensual and fiction. I've tried to explain that everything has boundaries, limits and clear communication and I've tried to educate them a little on the Kink.\n\nThey maintain the belief still that I need to reflect, and grow as a person. That I need to change the way that I navigate my sexual interests. Only then have they agreed to allow me back into the friend group.\n\nAny help is appreciated.

I currently work a full time job in addition to running half a horse ranch, and both money and free time are in very short supply for me. My mom told her that I was busy currently. \n\nShe has continued to reach out to my mom asking for me to take the time and make treats for everyone for the games, even though I wasn't even at the last few get togethers because of my obligations. Now my grandfather reached out to me, and I told him I can't afford to buy all the ingredients for the pumpkin bars right now because I can barely make ends meet.  He simply responded he would buy ingredients. \n\nI feel like these pumpkins came with strings attached and there is pressure on me to process them and use them for something I wasn't even planning for, and to be honest, if I'd known I was expected to produce something from them, I would have declined.  Now I'm struggling with trying to find time to do this and am feeling cornered.  AITAH if I don't make treats for the whole family with these pumpkins?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p6202y/aitah_for_not_making_treats_for_my_grandpas_wife/","permalink":"/r/AITAH/comments/1p6202y/aitah_for_not_making_treats_for_my_grandpas_wife/","score":5,"num_comments":24,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764041306.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Tonight, she wanted to have dinner and was going to make left overs from Friendsgiving. She said she wanted to eat left overs because her mom told her about some gov’t aid stuff that got canceled and all these countries now have people that are starving and dying. \n\nShe started going on a tangent and saying I’m not empathetic, how we vote helps the whole world, yada yada. \n\nI disagree entirely. We vote as a nation to help our country. Sorry that this government aid got canceled but I don’t make billions of dollars, I can’t just drop care packages over these countries, I work for my money and need to better my life so I can provide for a potential future family for us. \n\nShe feels like I’m the A-hole because I don’t like giving away money to homeless people begging for it on the side of the road and all these other things that have no impact on my life.
