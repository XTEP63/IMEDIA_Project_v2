{"id":"1p67hkg","name":"t3_1p67hkg","subreddit":"SteamDeck","author":"TGPaterson","title":"I built a 3D printed Steam Deck arcade machine and you can too! (STEP BY STEP)","selftext":"This is a follow up to this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1p5pd6d/i_designed_and_3d_printed_a_steam_deck_powered/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Thank you all for your kind comments, this is my first proper 3D design and build, so there's some things to be improved but this is a fully functional arcade cabinet that uses your Steam Deck as the brain. \n\nI started this project just as a bit of fun as I had some spare filament and a random monitor laying around. I used an application called OnShape to model it and I can't recommend it enough (it's free!). It spawned another project which was a hip-mounted Steam Machine using an old SD motherboard. I think stupid ideas like this is what I love about this community so please feel free to roast it lol. A few people wanted to know how I built that but I'll be saving that for another post as it's a bit more niche. \n\n  \nThe print files can be found on MakerWorld [HERE!](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2039426-steam-deck-arcade-machine#profileId-2200122)  \n  \n  \nAs I mentioned up top I'm new to this space and I've never shared files so let me know what could be improved.\n\n\n\n**Parts needed for this build:**\n\n22\" Monitor (I used Samsung LS22R350FHUXEN)\n\nPicade Max USB Controller   \nPicade Max USB Audio  \nPicade Max Encoder (Volume Control)  \nPimoroni Arcade Buttons x22  \nPimoroni Joystick x2  \nPimoroni 3\" Speaker 4Ω (5W)  \nUSB-C Hub (At least 3 USB ports) I use \"SABRENT M.2 NVMe Enclosure, USB Hub\"\n\n2x USB-C to USB (or USB-C depending on what hub you use) cables\n\nA set of M6 screws and nuts of various lengths (for the cabinet assembly)\n\nA set of M5 screws and nuts of various lengths (for the joysticks and speakers)\n\nA set of M4 screws and nuts (for the audio control board)\n\nM6 wooden dowels (may need to be shaped down with a knife to fit snug)\n\nSuper glue\n\n \n\nStep by step:\n\n1. Print all your parts using the provided file, pick whether you want the “Steam Machine” version of the middle left side or standard version for use with your Steam Deck dock. \n2. Once all the parts are printed align the side panels using the dowels and glue in place, you may need to use a rubber mallet to get the piece to fit snug. \n3. Next, use the M5 screws and nuts to attach the joysticks to their panels, at this point you can also add all of your arcade buttons. \n4. Use the M6 screws to combine all the cabinet parts together, except for the monitor brackets. \n5. Use the M4 and M5 screws to attach the audio control board, plug in your USB-C cable before this as it can be a pain to plug in afterwards.\n6. Using the monitor alignment plate combine the monitor brackets to the monitor, then attach to the rest of the cabinet. \n7. Now is the fun part, using your controller board and wires, plug in your buttons and use another USB-C cable to plug the boards into your dock.\n8. Once your Steam Deck is booted up, open the Steam Controller Input menu, disable Steam Input (else you'll have duplicate inputs) and test your button inputs. This part is trial and error as the labels on the board do not correlate to what Steam thinks is being pressed, so be patient and adjust the cables for each input. \n\n \n\nAnd there we go! You have a Steam Deck Arcade Cabinet, a few thing to note:\n\n \n\n* Sometime the audio can bug out and you'll need to either plug and unplug the USB cable for the controller or just switch the dock on/off.\n* I'm unsure whether the monitor I've used uses a standard mounting system, please print off the alignplate before printed any other parts to test whether your monitor fits.\n* This build is for 22\" monitors and under, so please do keep that in mind as well. \n* These control boards were made for Raspberry Pis, however due to that being Linux as well as the Steam Deck they work fairly well together! \n* If people are interested in the OnShape file, I can post a link in here once I've cleaned the file up. \n\nI'd love to see your builds or if you have any questions please let me know :) \n\n \n\nHave fun!!\n\n ","url":"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p67hkg","permalink":"/r/SteamDeck/comments/1p67hkg/i_built_a_3d_printed_steam_deck_arcade_machine/","score":256,"num_comments":17,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764060314.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Hardware Modding","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/lXNyA6jjB5HY76WiUsBqV6CY8Y0M5uaZbT0Ixy2PErU.jpg"}

One morning, my youngest brother burst into my room waking me up screaming that the place was on fire. The neighbor’s unit right beside ours had caught fire, and it spread quickly through the entire building.\n\n   Having just seconds to react. I threw on some clothes and grabbed the most important things I could think of, my passport, car keys, a guitar, and, my Steam Deck. Everything else was left behind.\n\n   Going through the aftermath of losing nearly all my belongings, the Steam Deck ended up becoming my Swiss Army knife without me even planning it. I used it every single day browsing the web, using it like a desktop, hooking it up to a TV to stream shows, and playing pretty much any game from my PC library.\n\n   Having the Steam Deck during all of this genuinely made things easier, and I’m incredibly grateful for this little device.

{"id":"1p6g3rr","name":"t3_1p6g3rr","subreddit":"SteamDeck","author":"VolTigrrr","title":"Gran Turismo 4 PCSX2 Framerate (and textures) problem","selftext":"Hello, i come here because i think have a problem with the emulation of this game. I followed this tutorial : [https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1dsbdg9/gran\\_turismo\\_4\\_ntscu\\_at\\_60fps\\_night\\_and\\_city/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1dsbdg9/gran_turismo_4_ntscu_at_60fps_night_and_city/), unchecked the SMT box in Power Tool, and I get 60 frames per second on every track, but the problem is that it's not consistent. For example, on night tracks, the frame rate drops below 60 and I sometimes experience minor slowdowns... I know that the Steam Deck can run this game at 60 frames per second all the time, even on night circuits. I only run this game with an HD texture pack (this one: [https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/gran-turismo-4-retexture-mod-v3-0-4.408852/](https://www.gtplanet.net/forum/threads/gran-turismo-4-retexture-mod-v3-0-4.408852/) combined with the Silentwarrior HD UI pack) and an enhanced resolution of up to 720p (i.e., x2). Some people can run this game with the same settings as me and have a constant frame rate of 60 fps, or even run this game at x3 resolution (1080p) with an HD texture pack on top of that.\n\nWhat I did next was go to the PCSX2 settings, under graphics, advanced, and set the “hardware download mode” to “disabled readback” because many people say that doing this on Gran Turismo 4 greatly improved their fps.\n\nAnd that was the case; by doing that, I was at a constant 60 fps on all tracks, even night tracks. But there was another problem: I had texture bugs with “disabled readback” mode (as shown in the photos below). What I did next was to remove the textures that were interfering with this mode, but the problem persisted, so I removed the HD texture pack and reverted to the game's vanilla textures. However, even without the texture pack, I still had the texture bugs shown in the images I sent. However, I'm running a very recent build of pcsx2 nightly (the latest at the time of writing), so normally it should work. On Reddit, YouTube, and other forums, I've seen that people haven't had any problems setting “hardware download mode” to “disable readback,” so I don't understand. And if I set the “hardware download mode” to “Accurate,” it doesn't solve my initial problem, which is having a constant 60 fps on all circuits (but the textures are no longer buggy).\n\nHowever, I followed everything in the tutorial i mentionned, in addition to setting the “Hardware download mode” to “disable readback,” but again, it didn't work.\n\nIf anyone has a solution to this, that would be great, or else I think I can live with my inconsistent fps\n\n[Gran Turismo 4 with these settings : \\\\\"Hardware Donwload Mode\\\\\" -\\> \\\\\"Disable Readback\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/4kqdlyltdf3g1.png?width=637&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8422e751294cfad388375de109effd0fa5e10e2)\n\n[Gran Turismo 4 with these settings : \\\\\"Hardware Donwload Mode\\\\\" -\\> \\\\\"Accurate\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/89j82zltdf3g1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b9ce258b0ace92d10aa9bfa4bcfb8d3e27391c4)\n\n[Gran Turismo 4 with these settings : \\\\\"Hardware Donwload Mode\\\\\" -\\> \\\\\"Disable Readback\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/db6tmyltdf3g1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=5409cb0d0ff0ecdb5f1f21935d28272c2d16b43d)\n\n[Gran Turismo 4 with these settings : \\\\\"Hardware Donwload Mode\\\\\" -\\> \\\\\"Accurate\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/bcbwhyltdf3g1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=baad1f70e409e9fed2f031df5843f927e4093b3d)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1p6g3rr/gran_turismo_4_pcsx2_framerate_and_textures/","permalink":"/r/SteamDeck/comments/1p6g3rr/gran_turismo_4_pcsx2_framerate_and_textures/","score":1,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764086212.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Tech Support","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/bXN5pA6FzV4s3n_vUxuBu0Q7VIOtMiQDbtf3SrsR8fw.jpg"}

If both are connected, their gyro works in „vertical“ position of holding the joy-cons. If I connect only one of them, it gets recognized as single joy-con and gyro works in „horizontal“ position. \n\n- If I connect them via the included dongle, they get recognized as Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. Does not matter if I connect one or both, always the switch pro controller and only the right one has a gyro option in Steam Input. \n\nThis is expected.\n\nBUT: if connected via dongle, the gyro orientation of the right joy-con is somehow set to „horizontal“. Meaning, only if I hold it horizontally, the gyro works as expected. This should not be the case. I want to use it vertically, just as you would use a Switch Pro Controller. \n\nNow I assume that it might be a SteamOS/Linux Problem. There were two moments, where the gyro suddenly was working in vertical orientation. I can‘t reproduce it reliably but it seems to happen if I switch to desktop mode, reconnect the controllers and play around with the Steam Input Layout. But not always… Also it works in Game Mode then, but at some point goes back to horizontal gyro orientation.\n\nAnybody got a hint? \n\nUPDATE: It seems that every time I switch to desktop mode and then back to game mode, gyro works as expected. If in game mode I turn off and on the joy-cons, I have to switch back to desktop mode again… also I noticed, that after switching the modes, back in game mode the page under Settings-Controller change to the ones in desktop mode. So it seems like gyro works as expected in desktop mode and only by switching between desktop and game mode, the desktop mode layout/settings are used in game mode? \n\nUPDATE2: Found under Gyro To Mouse [Beta] Settings-Gyro Orientation-Rotate Output. Set it to -90°, up and down kinda works with joy-con vertically but left and right is weird…","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1p6a6y6/aolion_j20_joycons_wrong_gyro_orientation/","permalink":"/r/SteamDeck/comments/1p6a6y6/aolion_j20_joycons_wrong_gyro_orientation/","score":1,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764070527.0,"edited":1764080700.0,"link_flair_text":"Tech Support","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I thought it was dead so I plugged it in, light came on, and it started up like normal. I let it charge for hours and it wouldn't turn on still without being plugged in. I tried going into bios, battery saver mode, and went into desktop mode and it says 100 percent battery. I've also tried more simple solutions like holding the power button for 30 secs, etc. it shuts off immediately when I unplug the charger from it. I'm not sure what else to do besides rma, but I really don't want to. Is there anyone else who went through this problem that fixed it? I'm thinking about opening the back and seeing if the battery is fully plugged in, since I've heard that fixed it for some people, however I want to be sure I've tried everything I can. Any recommendations? \n\nAlso for extra context I somehow mistook my phone charger for the steam one and used that to charge my deck. I'm not sure how many times or how long I've done this...
