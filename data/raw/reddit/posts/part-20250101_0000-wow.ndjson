Some of our members even traveled close to 1,000 km just to be there. That alone says a lot about how strong this community really is.\n\nAcross the three days we managed to pack in a bit of everything:  \n• guild competitions & mini-games (with actual prizes for the winners)  \n• long talks about raids, M+ disasters, lucky drops, guild memes and drama  \n• cooking, grilling, gaming and chilling  \n• and a whole lot of laughing, teasing and wholesome chaos\n\nWhat made it special wasn’t just the program... it was the people. Seeing so many of us together in one plac**e** felt surreal. We’ve spent years clearing keys and raids as a team, but meeting face-to-face brought a totally different kind of energy.

Frost was done well for Karesh and Unholy on beta is already amazes me. Super good both specs.\n\nDH: I'm not sure. Havoc is always nice, resource generation is a bit strange but I think with gear it will be better. Core hasnt changed much. Devourer is nice to have but so far I'm not sold on the spec. It's deffinitely great all in all but IDK. So far it hasn't clicked with me.\n\nEvoker. Devastation is amazing. Breath fire! BREATH DEEPER FIRE! Breath ARCANE! Jokes aside I really like what they done to Devoker and that feels more like an actual dragon to play with. Augmentation is IDK. Seems like the spec is either goated or nonexistent. Gona wait 1st season with that one.\n\nMage. Water boy is back and all it needed was to throw Fire spec into a volcano as a sacrifice...Frost feels nice but thats all to it, and so is arcane. Both are fine but nothing special to me. Still waiting for devs to fix fire spec and give meaning to its existence\n\nMonk: I'm still meditating on the state of WW. On 1 part I enjoy Zenith and both Shado-Pan and Celestial. On the other hand it feels overpruned. I miss Emperors Capacitor and it feels like it lacks at least one meaningful button. Xuen on celestialm akes sense but still.\n\nShaman: Both dps specs are just right and heavily thinking on this one. Overall its fine its great its visually impressive. Both really simple, enjoyable and managed to retain their cores. I'm thinking on this one for next xpac\n\nWarlock: Destruction is nearly the same. Easy to approach with cool stuff. Affliction is something I have high hopest to work out. I'm still testing talents but so far I'm optimistic. Demonolgy feels really great ad quite fun. The addition to get a felhunter and a disrupt is very sweet.\n\nSo far DK, Devoker and Shaman that is in my mind but what about you all?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1p66zdm/since_beta_is_available_for_some_time_tell_me/","permalink":"/r/wow/comments/1p66zdm/since_beta_is_available_for_some_time_tell_me/","score":127,"num_comments":298,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764058322.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":":midnight: Midnight Beta","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Once we’re sure the new planet is ready, those of us of who want out of the worst neighborhood in the galaxy are gonna portal on over there and *tell no one where the fuck we’re going!*\n\nAzeroth has some cool stuff on it. None of it is worth the sheer scale of suffering that we have to deal with just because we were unfortunate enough to get stuck on the galactic equivalent of a truck-stop toilet. This planet is the worst place to live. We should have thrown in the towel years ago and moved our asses out of here.\n\nIt’s just staggering, the sheer quantity of gods, demigods, and godlike or god-adjacent beings that are always seeking to destroy or conquer Azeroth. Even without the Burning Legion, we’ve still got Old Gods rooted into the world, and it’s not even clear whether they‘re really dead after we kill them. We’ve had close calls with the Titans wanting to re-originate the place, had two different versions of the same war-torn planet’s biggest war-machine come charging at us. \n\nDamn near every settlement and civilization you find is under threat from at least one, often several different things that threaten to wipe out its existence. Rival and/or invading factions, crazy wildlife, or apocalyptic cultists who found a niche god out of nowhere.\n\nHow many times have the elements themselves gone on a rampage? How many times? The Titans think we’re gross. The Old Gods love to screw with us. Every doomsday cult is 100% right, the elements usually hate us, sometimes the plants try to kill us, the animals almost always try to kill us, and the world itself is totally going to kerplode one day and probably kill everyone.

{"id":"1p6rll3","name":"t3_1p6rll3","subreddit":"wow","author":"OutrageousField415","title":"Solo Shuffle Is Fundamentally (and Statistically) Unfair for Healers","selftext":"After digging into how Solo Shuffle team rotations actually work, it’s pretty clear the mode mathematically geared in favour of DPS.\n\nIn every shuffle, there’s often one DPS who performs significantly worse than the others (we've all seen it where the same player gets targeted round after round).\n\nBecause each DPS is only paired with every other DPS twice, the “bad DPS” only drags each of the other three DPS down two rounds each. But healers? They’re paired with that DPS three times, meaning they absorb more of the losses/bad play and have far fewer opportunities to break even or climb.\n\nThis is why DPS routinely get 4–2 outcomes (and climb), while healers get stuck in endless 3–3 lobbies that award almost no rating. The system itself makes healer progression slower and less rewarding.\n\nIf Blizzard wants to fix the healer shortage (and I'm unsure if they do) the solution isn’t tuning classes, it’s fixing the rating system. Even adding a small positive rating bump for 3–3 healer games would go a long way toward making the role feel less punishing and more worthwhile.\n\nRight now, the maths of Solo Shuffle just doesn’t respect the people actually keeping everyone alive.\n\nReposted as this was removed from r/Worldofpvp. Unclear why\n\nApologies if this has been raised before but I'm a returning player raising what I believe to be a flawed element of pvp\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1p6rll3/solo_shuffle_is_fundamentally_and_statistically/","permalink":"/r/wow/comments/1p6rll3/solo_shuffle_is_fundamentally_and_statistically/","score":23,"num_comments":14,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764112152.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":":discussion: Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

A year later and I have been thoroughly pleased, all settings run at ultra, I am still grateful and loving it!\n\nNow I’m looking forward to midnight and I have several questions I could use more of your opinions or education on! Let me start by linking my pc and monitor:\n\nAegis ZS2. Msi rtx4070 Ryzen 7 8700f\nAEGIS Z2 C8NUE-1059US\nhttps://www.microcenter.com/product/685639/msi-aegis-z2-c8nue-1059us-gaming-pc\n\nKTC H27S17 27 inch curved 1440p 170hz\nhttps://www.amazon.com/KTC-FreeSync-DisplayPort-Ultrawide-H27S17/dp/B0B398KZWJ\n\n1) With the last gpu shortage and the ai craze / “RAMagedon” right now, should I be considering any hardware upgrades before the market gets any worse or am I in a good position to keep all my settings maxed for the next couple years? \n\n2) I think this monitor is great, but that’s me with a sample group of 1.. I’ve considered Oled but would I not have to worry about burn in from let’s say 8 hours of wow ui on screen everyday? I’m inclined to think I’d have obvious burn in after a few years, would anyone suggest otherwise? As cool as a 49inch ultra wide oled would be for immersion I just don’t think it’s practical for my usage. \n\n3) That said, would higher tier/ more premium  1440p non oled monitors actually give a dramatic improvement to image quality? Or more of a shiny side grade with more features with slightly more contrast, etc?\n\n4) I really like the size and dimensions of this curved ktc monitor, so I intend to get another curved  27inch and dual screen. In addition this would also fit/fill the rest of my desk space fully.  My entire set up is purely for WoW (no productivity here!), search tabs perhaps some multi-boxing with 2 accounts and 42 lvl80s all retail. I believe I can dual screen now no problem, which brings me back to what’s the best fit daily driver main screen for me now Or should I be considering pc upgrades first? I know monitor preference  is a highly subjective opinion in a flooded market place but I hope some of you with a lot more knowledge and experience can educated me towards a path forward!\n\nI’m know I am asking a ton of stuff, so any input on any point is much appreciated! \n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1p6r2wc/is_my_hardware_ready_for_midnight_full_ultra/","permalink":"/r/wow/comments/1p6r2wc/is_my_hardware_ready_for_midnight_full_ultra/","score":0,"num_comments":4,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764110849.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
