{"id":"1otq5wc","name":"t3_1otq5wc","subreddit":"Music","author":"Fterranella","title":"Curtis Lee: The story of a 1960s one-hit wonder","selftext":"[Curtis Lee \\(1939-2015\\)](https://preview.redd.it/9su0kxz4wh0g1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ea98dbcbe682427effe6a4718c1d6442e6675e5)\n\nThe early 1960s were not the most creative time for popular music. Rock and roll seemed to be losing popularity as many Americans came to associate it with juvenile delinquency. Its decline in popularity was fueled by the fact that many of its biggest stars were either in trouble or otherwise not recording. \n\nFor example, Jerry Lee Lewis saw his career slammed into a wall when in December, 1957 he married his first cousin who was young enough that their relationship would today likely be considered statutory rape. Chuck Berry was arrested in December 1959 for violating the Mann Act for bringing a 14-year-old across state lines to work as a hat-check girl in his St. Louis nightclub. And the \"king of rock and roll\" Elvis Presley was in the Army from 1958 to 1960. \n\nSo as a result, the top song of 1960 was \"Theme from A Summer Place,\" recorded by Percy Faith. Singers like Brenda Lee, Connie Francis and Bobby Rydell filled the void. \n\nAnd into this milieu came Curtis Lee, a 21-year-old fledgling singer from Yuma, Arizona. He had cut three songs for small labels while he was still in his teens. He was heard by singer Ray Peterson (\"Tell Laura I Love Her\"), who'd just started a label of his own called Dunes. He invited Lee to cut a demo if he came to New York.  \n\nLee arrived in New York in late 1960, and started writing songs in partnership with a friend, Tommy Boyce. (Boyce was a Brill Building composer who later joined up with Bobby Hart to write many of the songs recorded by The Monkees.)\n\nPeterson agreed to record Lee and Boyce's song, \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes.” He hired Phil Spector, who had given him a hit with \"Corrine, Corrina,\" to produce the record. \n\nThe song was recorded at Mira Sound Studios on West 47th Street in Manhattan in June 1961. Spector was not impressed by Lee's squeaky voice and decided that something extra was needed to pump life into \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes.\" For the background vocals, Spector brought in a black quartet, the Halos, who were an experienced do-wop group. \n\nArthur Cryer, the Halos' bass man and leader, recalled : \"We came in and Spector gave us the lyric sheets and told us to do what we felt\". The year 1961 was the time of a mini doo-wop revival, and the Halos' vocal riffs came straight out of the 1950s uptempo doo-wop school and made the song infectious. \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes\" peaked at # 7 on the Billboard charts in the summer of 1961. In Spector's hands, it had become a tribute to doo-wop.\n\nUnfortunately, this was to be Lee's one and only Top 40 hit. He left the music business in 1969 and went into the construction industry with his father.  He died in 2015 at the age of 75.\n\nCurtis Lee may have been a one-hit wonder, but the distinctive sound of \"Pretty Little Angel Eyes\" has kept the recoding in the rotation at oldies radio stations for the last half century. It's a fun song and one of the last hits of the genre known as Doo-Wop.

In [**this Medium article**](https://thebolt.medium.com/making-space-for-music-1fd9f82dc3d1), our CMO, Jennifer Sullivan, explores how we can restore the emotional and cultural weight of recorded music, and what it means for artists, fans, and the industry to reclaim presence in a digital world. Would love to hear more thoughts on this! Also, **please share any specific experiences where you, as a music fan, were deeply connected and/or moved by a unique listening experience.**\n\n*\"Music has always evolved alongside technology, but somewhere along the way, artists were asked to shrink themselves to fit the limits of the platforms that distribute them. Algorithms reward consistency over creativity, and presence has been replaced with visibility.* \n\n*Making space for music means creating room for artistry, depth, and context. These are spaces where music can be felt, not just played. Taking up space means reclaiming ownership and long-term value in a system that rewards short-term visibility.

I’d say I’m influenced by parents music taste but also from popular media such as the radio stations on GTA5 (Non-Stop Pop has some excellent records). \n\nI listen to all sorts of music - house, rap, pop, 70s, 80s, 90s, 00s, - anything. I sometimes listen to music that has negative undertones and subject themes, mainly rap music which is often violent and contains damaging perspectives and cliches. I’m not saying rap is inherently bad at all, I love it, just some is better than others.\n\nBut today driving home from work, I played my recently created collection of music from the 70s, 80s, 90s - all upbeat classics, some of the finest music ever released. Prince, Bowie, INXS, The S.O.S Band, Fleetwood Mac, Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, Pet Shop Boys + more…\n\nAnd I feel noticeably happier and positive, feeling more optimistic. I think music is one of the most incredible things out there. People create something they sound good, sometimes that delivers a message and it can help drastically improve someone’s life. Not to sound nihilistic but no matter what happens politically or what the price of eggs are wherever you live - we always have music. \n\nI could talk about this all day, just wrote a short message to try articulate what I was thinking. No matter what music you like, it’s an expression and an extension of you. \n\n“Music is life itself” - Louis Armstrong","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1otnmif/music_is_so_powerful/","permalink":"/r/Music/comments/1otnmif/music_is_so_powerful/","score":1,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762803488.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Both songs straight up dominated 2000. Christina had everybody dancing and singing along with Come On Over, while LeAnn had us feeling all the moonlit vibes with Can’t Fight The Moonlight. You couldn’t escape either one — they were on every radio station, every movie, and blasting everywhere.\n\nCome On Over was that upbeat, pop perfection — catchy, fun, and impossible not to jam to 🎶. And Can’t Fight The Moonlight? That was all the drama, romance, and cinematic magic. Totally different moods but both just iconic in their own way.\n\nFor me, it’s tough — but I might lean toward Can’t Fight The Moonlight just because that one still hits differently every time.\n\nWhat about y’all?

Between TikTok, YouTube, Bandcamp, and streaming playlists, it’s almost impossible to keep up with how fast new sounds travel. You can go from finding a bedroom producer in Brazil to a metal-rap collab from Japan in the same scroll.\n\nIt’s easy to say things were better when music moved slower, but there’s something wild about how connected and experimental everything feels right now. Music has never been this global or this accessible.\n\nStill, it makes me wonder if this constant discovery makes it harder to *really* connect with anything long term. There’s always something new waiting to replace what you just found.\n\nDo you think this is the most exciting time for music discovery, or has the constant stream made it harder to actually appreciate what’s out there?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1otp3sj/are_we_living_in_the_most_exciting_era_for_music/","permalink":"/r/Music/comments/1otp3sj/are_we_living_in_the_most_exciting_era_for_music/","score":0,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762806740.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Every time I see an artist with a list of actually good songs, they always end up having hundreds of thousands of followers.\nI really think that your success in the music industry depends on : \n1) Wheather the song you made is catchy enough \n2) You're not only representing your songs singing them but you yourself are the music, as in the kind of music you write is speaking through you\n3) You're attracting a certain major group of listeners\n4) Time and consistency \n\nMany people make it seem like becoming a famous singer is a lottery ticket but I don't think so, 9/10 times their songs just don't level up to the expectations or isn't catchy enough.

It’s music for the outsiders, the originals, the ones who carve their own path through noise and silence.
