Testing their growing partnership like never before, they go under cover in new parts of town to crack the case.*\n\nDirector: Jared Bush, Byron Howard\n\nCast: Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Ke Huy Quan, Idris Elba, Quinta Brunson, Jenny Slate, Brenda Song, Dwayne Johnson, Shakira, Andy Samberg, CM Punk, Roman Reigns, Jean Reno, Macauley Culkin, Alan Tudyk, John Leguizamo, Josh Gad, Danny Trejo\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:** [95%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/zootopia_2)\n\n**Metacritic:** [75 / 100](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/zootopia-2/)\n\nSome Reviews:\n\n[RogerEbert - Nell Minow](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/zootopia-2-movie-review) \\- 4 / 4\n\n>The details are dazzling, rewarding repeat viewings. Disney magic radiates from every texture and movement, and a near-vertiginous sense of space and momentum. There are car chases through the streets and one where characters travel by Tube, not as in the London Underground but as in a miles-long, water-filled tube, and it’s all visually dazzling.\n\n[The Independent - Clarisse Loughrey](https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/zootropolis-2-movie-review-b2872048.html) \\- 4 / 5\n\n>*Zootropolis 2* reframes the original’s metaphor for racism in a sounder, more thought-out way. In the first, the wave of fear and discrimination against predators like Nick was given material justification in the fact predators like Nick had been repeatedly attacking people (only under the influence of psychotropic substances). Some of the broad strokes of are the same as the first movie, with the same contractually obliged reappearances from Flash Slothmore (Raymond S Persi), Gazelle (Shakira), and the Shrewfather himself, Mr Big (Maurice LaMarche). Yet, there’s more than enough of a change of scenery to never feel like we’re watching a dog chase its own tail, and an endless supply of visual jokes and references. A disgruntled rodent will appear to jostle any cans stuck in the vending machine; in the Louisiana-flavoured Marsh Market, there are jazz-slinging lizards and sea lions easily offended by the term “seal”.\n\n[Flix - Nathan Swank](https://flix66.com/zootopia-2-movie-review/) \\- 3.5 / 5\n\n>ZOOTOPIA 2 might be one of the funniest films of the year. The adults were laughing as much as the kids and not because of some inappropriate innuendos, but rather witty references to recognizable life situations. Judy Hopps receives a text from her dad that is identical to what I receive on a daily basis from my supportive, aging parents. Background jokes of cleverly named animal themed versions of popular movies, the same pig character getting drinks spilled on him at a party, or a simple yo mama joke keeps everyone engaged and laughing. ZOOTOPIA 2 proves that the old R-rated, comedic buddy cop formula can easily transition for the PG-family friendly crowd to great success.\n\n[DEADLINE - Dessi Gomez](https://deadline.com/2025/11/zootopia-2-review-disney-1236627513/)\n\n>Ultimately, the sequel delivers on its message to tell the truth about historical events, fight for one’s beliefs and stand up to power and money. The climax that reflects debates about identity, official cover ups and who controls a narrative. Hilarious nods to Disney animation films like *Ratatouille* and the return of favorite faces — like Shakira’s Gazelle with a catchy new tune “Zoo” — from the first film bring humor and fun to a story of justice and embracing differences. And if that post-credit scene is anything to go by, there may be hope for a third film that takes viewers into a previously unexplored realm.\n\n[Slant Magazine - Derek Smith](https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/zootopia-2-review/) \\- 3 / 4\n\n>Bush’s screenplay both effortlessly and elegantly weaves Judy and Nick’s personal drama into this larger story about the importance, and difficulty, of exposing widespread corruption and historical erasure. Advocating for the importance of individual action in the face of bigotry codified into law, *Zootopia 2* provides plenty of food for thought for its young audience, making a more expansive statement on the dangers of intolerance than the first film, and without sacrificing any of its charm, humor, or visual ingenuity along the way.\n\n[AttractionsMagazine - Mateo Osorio](https://attractionsmagazine.com/zootopia-2-movie-review-disney-animation-2025/) \\- 4 / 5\n\n>Not only is the movie extremely entertaining but as Disney movies used to be known for, very moving as well. The relationship between Nick (Jason Bateman) and Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) tugs on the heartstrings of fans of the duo, but the star of the show in my eyes is the social commentary this movie touches on. I can’t dive too deep into that without giving away big plot spoilers, but I will say that “Zootopia 2” has some of the most relevant messaging in an animated movie from the 2020s so far. Disney does such an amazing job at writing real-world issues in a way that families can enjoy without worrying that it might be too much for their little ones.\n\n[Next Best Picture - Dan Bayer](https://nextbestpicture.com/zootopia-2/) \\- 8 / 10\n\n>“Zootopia 2“ is a marvel of modern animated storytelling, a family film that really will have everyone in the family laughing, singing (in the case of the earworm “Zoo,“ sung by Shakira’s Zootopian pop star Gazelle), and perhaps even crying together.\n\n[The Guardian - Peter Bradshaw](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/nov/25/zootropolis-2-review-just-about-passable-family-comedy-sequel-might-as-well-be-ai-generated) \\- 2 / 5\n\n>There are a few laughs in Z2: of course there are. But they are algorithmically generated and corporately approved. It’s the kind of movie you put on an iPad to keep the children quiet on a long plane or train journey; nothing wrong with that of course, but the heart and soul are lacking.\n\n[Seattle Times - Soren Anderson](https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/zootopia-2-review-disneys-sequel-lacks-sweet-charm-of-the-original/) \\- 2.5 / 4\n\n>The sweetness in the original is absent in the sequel. The players, including Judy and Nick, have an edge to them. Maybe that’s to be expected in that the main characters are now more settled in their parts, but there’s a sharpness in tone that makes them hard to warm up to.\n\n[AV Club - Caroline Siede](https://www.avclub.com/zootopia-2-review) \\- 'B-'\n\n>Zootopia 2 is a stagnant sequel with one stellar subplot. As family entertainment, it’s all perfectly fine. There are plenty of callbacks to the original to delight young fans (including a catchy new song from Shakira’s Gazelle) and plenty of knowing jokes for the adults in the audience. A sequel of this magnitude has the ability to reach higher, though, with more creative worldbuilding balancing out the dime-a-dozen pop culture references and cheap gags. Given that a post-credits scene hints a third installment may be on the horizon, Disney is clearly still invested in *Zootopia* as a franchise. Hopefully it can remain invested in its artistic evolution too.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p6hrez/zootopia_2_review_thread/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1p6hrez/zootopia_2_review_thread/","score":1130,"num_comments":374,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764089874.0,"edited":1764099326.0,"link_flair_text":"Review","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Naturally, I thought I'd come to reddit and see what others popped up and how many people will disagree with these 3 directors I don't like.\n\n1.  Woody Allen - I never got his neurosis-as-performance schtick.  His insecurity isn't funny or charming to me.  Even if he's NOT in the movie, there's a character that's always a Woody-stand-in.  His characters never grow, never learn...everyone else around him changes.  The women in his films are fantasies for insecure males and there are zero stakes.  \n\n2. Terence Malick - IMHO, he loves his camera more than his characters (outside of Badlands which I enjoy).  For him, the camera is the character....which doesn't give me any reason to care about characters.  So while his films are visually-stunning, they're emotionally empty to me.\n\n3.  Lars von Trier - Watching a von Trier movie is more of an exercise in endurance as to how much suffering I can withstand over the next 2 hours.  And he has a particular style that I find not only annoying but takes me out of the movie.  Here they are: a.  He removes agency from his characters, b.  He engineers the world as hostile to his protagonist, c.  There's no counterweight to any trauma, d.  He relies on performers to give the appearance of humanity.  Von Trier fans like to pass him off as if his suffering is making some sort of profound statement.  They're not.  It's suffering for the sake of suffering.  \n\n  \n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p6oyzt/what_are_some_famous_and_respected_directors_that/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1p6oyzt/what_are_some_famous_and_respected_directors_that/","score":158,"num_comments":672,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764105827.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

{"id":"1p6271y","name":"t3_1p6271y","subreddit":"movies","author":"Stankassmfgorilla","title":"Films with Theatrical Cuts that are better than Director's Cut/Extended Edition?","selftext":"I feel that most director's cuts/extended editions of films are actually inferior to the theatrical versions. That isn't to say that they're all bad, but in many instances, the director's cut usually kills the flow of the film. A theatrical cut isn't always done because of studio interference. Most of the time, scenes are left out for a reason. \n\nMy most controversial take is that the theatrical cuts of The Lord of the Rings trilogy are vastly superior to the Extended Editions. Maybe it's just because I watched the Theatrical Versions countless times growing up, but any time I watch the Extended Editions, I find myself taken out by the differences. The edits from the Theatrical Versions stick out like a sore thumb. They aren't bad by any means, but the pacing of the Theatrical Versions is much tighter, which is crucial for such long movies. The Theatrical Version of Fellowship of the Ring is literally a perfect film. Not an ounce of fat on there. Even Peter Jackson prefers the Theatrical Editions and says he put the Extended Editions together for the most hardcore fans. \n\nAnother is Step Brothers. One of my favorites comedies that I feel really gets hampered by its Director's Cut. The pacing grinds to a halt and the jokes don't really land. The theatrical cut is much tighter. It's crazy how much of a difference a few minutes makes. \n\nSpider Man 2.1 is also vastly inferior to the theatrical version. I've seen people praise it as the \"definitive edition\" of the film, and I don't understand why. A briskly paced and perfectly edited film that is elongated for no good reason. The added scenes were unnecessary and didn't add anything to the story or what it was saying. \n\nA lot of the time, the Theatrical Cut is what the director intended to be seen by everyone. What are your examples of a Theatrical Cut that is the superior version? \n\n*EDIT: I would say the most essential Director’s Cut is the Extended Edition of Once Upon A Time In America. At 251 minutes, it isn’t even Leone’s full vision, but it’s the closest we’ll ever get. It completes the story as much as it can.

Landing the film rights to James Islington’s Hierarchy series, with the second book in the series just releasing on November 11 in the U.S.  The first book, titled The Will of the Many, was released in 2023, and the second book, The Strength of the Few, debuted at the top slot of the New York Times’ best sellers.\n\nSimon & Schuster is the publishing company behind Islington’s releases, specifically the Saga Press division. While it is still early days for any future project and no producers or filmmaker is attached, Peter Kang and Louie Provost have been tapped to oversee the project.  This is a big get for Sony, as the second book in the trilogy also debuted number one in Canada and is at the top of the charts in the U.K. and Australia.  Islington’s breakout as a writer came in the form of the Licanius trilogy.  He self-published the first book in the series, and was subsequently picked up by publishing company Orbit Ltd. for the second and third installments.  His 2023 release, The Will of the Many, has been rated by 170,000 people on Goodreads; 120,000 of those reviewers gave it 5 stars, and it has also received serious recognition for various awards.  He secured the 2023 Aurealis Award, which is an Australian-based award that recognizes excellence in the broad fantasy genre. As things stand, Islington has sold north of 2.5 million books, and said books have been translated into seventeen languages.\n\nSony now has the rights to develop films based on Islington’s Hierarchy world, and Borys Kit of The Hollywood Reporter detailed what they’ll be working with. “Set in a Roman Empire-style civilization but infused with magic, the Hierarchy series follows Vis, a young man hiding a life-threatening secret, as he’s forced to investigate a death while also infiltrating the all-powerful regime that feeds on the mental and physical energy, dubbed the Will, of the masses. Vis uncovers conspiracies that pull him into a rebellion that could upend the world order. What began as a mission of survival becomes a sweeping fight against a world built on exploitation, where loyalty, power and truth are all weaponized.”\n\nNot sure how to feel about this. On the one hand, awesome that more people will be exposed to this fantastic series. On the other hand, the story’s way too dense and would be more suited to a 15-episode season on HBO Max, Apple TV etc.","url":"https://movies.mxdwn.com/news/sony-secures-rights-to-new-york-times-number-one-best-seller-book-series/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1p61g3s/sony_films_secures_rights_to_james_islingtons/","score":23,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764039677.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"News","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://external-preview.redd.it/yC3JfTiyMQqVb2ugDAoZS6JCReG-Ic1LtVAtk1c5UhY.png?width=140&height=140&auto=webp&s=f48626dea19abc2f26163433711e1234d7ba0f85"}

I never see it on anyone's \"best films of the decade\" list or anything. It didn't really do much to boost anyone involved's careers or lead to more biopics taking a similarly experimental approach. It's like it just had no impact whatsoever. It came and went, despite having the quality to make it a modern classic.\n\nIn my opinion, it's a truly phenomenal film. With Aaron Sorkin's brilliant, snappy writing and Danny Boyle's exceptional ability to make such a dialogue-heavy script feel so cinematic, I just can't say enough good things about it. It's been compared to The Social Network (for fairly shallow reasons, honestly) and I don't think it falls too short of that. It doesn't follow a generic biopic template or anything. It just takes three key moments from Steve Jobs' career and focuses the plot around them. Each act is stylistically different from the last, but they all work together as you see the entire cast developing over the runtime. It highlights the dark parts of Jobs' personality but also gives him credit for his unique talents, resulting in an extremely complex characterization. I loved it.\n\nThoughts?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p6ta55/why_does_no_one_ever_talk_about_steve_jobs_2015/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1p6ta55/why_does_no_one_ever_talk_about_steve_jobs_2015/","score":0,"num_comments":14,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764116551.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

All of which are fun action comedies, and I think he would of made a great director for the 4th film. Plus he's worked as a Stuntman before, so it would've be so cool to see him to see him interact with Jackie and Chris, and how they would work on these fight scenes and stunts.\n\n  \nIlya Naishuller - his filmography involves Hardcore Henry, Nobody and Heads Of State. He would've been a decent choice to direct the film. I really like those films so I think he would of done a fun Rush Hour film.\n\n  \nJonathan Eusebio - The only film he's directed is Love Hurts which wasn't good, but I think he would've good choice for Rush Hour 4. He did great action with Love Hurts, so I think his style would of worked of another Rush Hour.\n\n  \nout of all the directors, I would say David Leitch would've been perfect to direct Rush Hour 4. He's my favorite Action director right now, and I really liked what he did with Hobbs and Shaw, so this would been really cool to see!!\n\n  \n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1p6lce6/3_directors_who_wouldve_been_better_choices_to/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1p6lce6/3_directors_who_wouldve_been_better_choices_to/","score":0,"num_comments":13,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764097673.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

However, I did finished watching all of Alien: Earth (season one) on Hulu and even I didn't care much for this show. Nor do I even care about the characters, or the fact that the show has been greenlit for another season or \"expanding the lore\" or some crap like that. I was just done with the Alien franchise after the first season of Alien: Earth, because it just hasn't giving me anything new or challenging. The only times 20th Century Fox actually did something new or challenging with the Alien lore was with Alien VS Predator 1 and 2 and Prometheus. That's it. Everything else after Prometheus just felt repetitive, predictable and kind of boring. I can understand why many people were disappointed with Aliens 3 because well, they thought the stakes were going to be hire with more Xenomorphs coming. But nope, we only got one Xenomorphs on a space prison colony where they have no guns. Oh and the religious mythos thing in the third film, yeah, I didn't care much about all that. Then you have Alien: Resurrection which definitely ruined the franchise almost 20 years. But my God, that was just a really dumb movie on its own. Yet, it's still more watchable and memorable than Alien: Covenant and Alien: Earth (Season One) all together. Don't even ask why.
