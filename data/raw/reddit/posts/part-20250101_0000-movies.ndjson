{"id":"1otq7lv","name":"t3_1otq7lv","subreddit":"movies","author":"ButlerWimpy","title":"\"Rango\" is a triumph of meta-modern storytelling.","selftext":"I recently re-watched the 2011 animated film Rango, and was reminded of how well it incorporates contemporary ideas about constructing one's own identity into the framework of a classic \"hero's journey\" morality tale. To me, it juggles postmodern existentialism, individualist modernism, and (somewhat subversively) traditional morality in a clever way. It starts out as existential because the chameleon character starts out with no identity and has to create one based on the situation he finds himself in. (Obviously, he's a chameleon.) But, importantly, he also has an internal idea of the story he'd like to tell based on his imagination, which defines his lonely fish tank existence, and seemingly inspired by cinema (he fancies himself as an actor). Unfortunately for him, he isn't able to successfully bring that self-constructed (but externally influenced) story into reality by his own volition. He fails, and is left wandering in the desert. \n\nThe movie's core scene is brought into play when Rango (which the chameleon names himself) deconstructs the walls of the story he's set himself in and allows himself to be guided across the road, not by way of his own heroism but by closing his eyes and trusting in something external. There he is confronted by the Spirit of the West, who in one sense represents traditional morality (he is portrayed as omniscient, a \"higher being\" as a human amongst animals, and provides Rango moral guidance), but is also representative of both modernist hero narratives (individualist American Westerns) and, complicatedly, postmodern anti-hero narratives (spaghetti Westerns). It would have been more straightforward to just use John Wayne or something and reinforce modernist individualism, but rather than being on-the-nose, using the Man with No Name incorporates the complications of fractured identity into the movie's resolution.\n\nHe tells Rango that Rango is trying to \"find something that isn't out here\"--that \"something\" being Rango's preconceived notion of what his story should be, or needs to be. For the story to be merely existentialist, the thread would end with that deconstruction of the notion of a traditionally defined goal. But, the Spirit follows with the message that \"it's not about you, it's about them.\" This is traditional morality undermining Rango's self-important, self-constructed role as a modernist hero, and reinforcing that he needs to define himself not by a myopic view of what \"heroes should be,\" but instead define himself by the moral service he is able to provide others. The spirit then symbolically \"boxes in\" Rango, framing him as if on a movie screen, implying that Rango has confined himself by the modernist, classic Hollywood ideal of a Hero narrative. The spirit then rides away with the remark that \"no man can walk out on his own story,\" summarizing the philosophy of the film by submitting that we all inescapably exist within a larger story, but despite that larger framework which is the \"story\" of human existence, it is also *our own* story, in which our individual identity and choices must be guided by both traditional morality, and a sense of the individual talents and limitations that make us ourselves. Not solely what the modernist hero story imposes on us.\n\nSo, rather than being simply deconstructionist and postmodern, it is instead meta-modern, acknowledging the postmodern moral uncertainty of a post-WWII, post-nuclear world, and the utility of modernist hero narratives, but rejecting the naivety of either philosophy on its own, and instead incorporating both, along with traditional morality, towards a more nuanced positive message. \n\nIt's not unique in doing so; plenty of other stories since around the 2000s have been doing similar things. But it does a really good job of it. The surreal presentation serves the philosophy of the narrative as well. The rendering of the environments and characters is scientifically realistic, but the logic the world works in, the way things move and act, is cartoony and dream-like. It marries the grounded, directed certainty of modernism with the absurdity of postmodernism. The genre tropes and Western cliches are at once treated with reverence and also undermined by the subtle, tongue-in-cheek acting and occasional naturalistic dialogue. The mariachi owls reinforce the self-awareness that the movie is playing with narrative presentation itself and examining the utility of traditional storytelling frameworks, which is meta-modern.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1otq7lv/rango_is_a_triumph_of_metamodern_storytelling/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1otq7lv/rango_is_a_triumph_of_metamodern_storytelling/","score":130,"num_comments":30,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762809240.0,"edited":1762815034.0,"link_flair_text":"Review","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

This debut is also very close to ***Alien: Romulus*** ($42 million) last year.\n\nEven though ***Prey*** and ***Killer of Killers*** were sent to streaming, Disney had enough confidence in the film that they enlisted Dan Trachtenberg to return as director and giving it a theatrical release. To separate itself from the previous installments, the film went on a bigger scale, positioning the Predator to fight large monsters. And despite casting Elle Fanning as co-lead, it was clear that humans were not the focus of the film. \n\nA few weeks prior, it was revealed that the film would be rated PG-13, the first film in the franchise (excluding ***AvP***) to get it. That led to some disappointment from fans, but the rating did not fundamentally impact the film in a negative way. The rating was mainly because the level of violence wasn't aimed at humans, so the MPAA was a bit lenient in that way. And despite the rating, it still had the reception to justify it; it's sitting at 85% on RT and 71 on Metacritic, which convinced everyone that this is the theatrical ***Predator*** film they were waiting for.\n\nAccording to 20th Century Studios, 61% of the audience was male. Despite the PG-13 rating, it didn't really benefit much from it; only 11% of the audience was 17 and under. They gave it a great \"A–\" on CinemaScore, the best ever in the franchise. Even with some competition on the way, the film should still hold around the same as ***Romulus***. Which means it should be the franchise's first film to crack $100 million domestically.\n\n***Regretting You*** has kept the second place for the third week in a row. The film eased a very light 15%, adding $6.6 million. The film is clearly showing some damn great legs. The film has earned $38.1 million, and it should finish with over $50 million, which is much better than its early prospects.\n\nIn third place, ***Black Phone 2*** eased just 38%, adding $5.1 million this weekend. The film has made $70 million, and it should finish with around $80 million domestically. Not a bad run at all.\n\nIn fourth place, Amazon MGM's ***Sarah's Oil*** debuted with a so-so $4.2 million in 2,410 theaters. It's a soft debut, but it's hard to ask for much better numbers here. On some good news, it scored a rare \"A+\" on CinemaScore, which bodes well for its legs.\n\nComing in over projections, Sony Pictures Classics' ***Nuremberg*** opened with a solid $3.8 million in 1,802 theaters. Its $2,155 per-theater average was also the second best in the Top 10, just behind ***Badlands***. That's a very surprising result, considering that the film didn't have particularly great reviews (69% on RT, 61 on Metacritic) and both Russell Crowe and Rami Malek have struggled in the past few years. Not a bad start, especially compared to two other newcomers we're about to talk about...\n\n***Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc*** is holding surprisingly well for an anime title. It dropped just 45%, for a $3.4 million weekend. The film's domestic total stands at $37.8 million.\n\nYorgos Lanthimos' ***Bugonia*** added $3.4 million this weekend. That represents a very light 32% drop, signaling some great word of mouth. Through its first 2 weeks in wide release, the film has amassed $12.2 million (Lanthimos' third highest grossing film) and could crack $20 million, assuming it continues holding well.\n\nIn eighth place, MUBI's ***Die My Love*** flopped with just $2.6 million in 1,983 theaters. In comparison, MUBI's buzzy title ***The Substance*** earned $3.2 million in 1,949 theaters last year. It's one of the worst ever wide debuts for both Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson.\n\nA film like this was always going to be a tough sell; a film focusing on post-partum depression is not on many moviegoers' minds. Upon premiering in Cannes, MUBI bought the film for a record $24 million (far more than the $12.5 million they spent on acquiring ***The Substance***), which guaranteed at least 1,500 theaters. But it seems like they over-estimated the appeal and its reception; the film is sitting at a 76% on RT, which is solid, but not particularly glowing for an adult drama. It just doesn't have the buzz that ***The Substance*** achieved. So even though MUBI tried an extensive marketing campaign by having many press junkets, the film just didn't attract any interest.\n\nAccording to MUBI, 51% of the audience was male, and 78% was in the 18-34 demographic. They gave it a horrible \"D+\" on CinemaScore, signaling toxic word of mouth. Even though Lawrence has gained some buzz for her performance, it's very unlikely the film can last long with this reception. Especially when there's more Oscar contenders coming up. It would be a surprise if ***Die My Love*** made anything above $6 million domestically.\n\n***Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere*** dropped 44% and added $2.1 million this weekend. That took its domestic total to $20.3 million, and it will finish with around $25 million domestically.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 is ***Tron: Ares***. It dropped 40%, grossing $1.8 million. The film has made a meager $71.2 million, and it only has around $5 million left in the gas tank. \n\nFailing to crack the Top 10 was Black Bear's ***Christy***, starring Sydney Sweeney, which flopped with an abysmal $1.3 million in 2,011 theaters. That's the 13th worst debut for a film playing in 2,000 theaters, and it gets to 11th if we exclude re-releases. That's an abysmal $652 per-theater average.\n\nDespite Sweeney going on a press tour and extensively promoting it, the film just couldn't attract any interest. It was Black Bear's first distributed film, but that just proves the challenge of getting in the theatrical business. The film also lacked an interesting hook or subject matter; Christy Martin may not ring a bell to moviegoers, so they'll be less interested in checking out a biopic. Sweeney's presence has also been marred with controversies over the past months; while it's hard to say it negatively impacted it, it certainly didn't help it. The film's middling reviews (67% on RT) were the nail in the coffin.\n\nAudiences gave ***Christy*** a middling \"B+\" on CinemaScore, which is not a sign of great word of mouth. With zero Oscar buzz, adult dramas coming on its way, and theaters absolutely dropping it with such a pitiful debut, ***Christy*** might struggle to hit $3 million domestically.\n\nLet's cap it off with some great news. Neon released Joachim Trier's ***Sentimental Value*** in 4 theaters, and it debuted with a dazzling $200,031. That's a strong $50,008 per-theater average, which ranks sixth best of the year (fourth best with at least 2 theaters). The film will continue expanding over the next few weeks, hoping to capitalize on some Oscar buzz.\n\n#**OVERSEAS**\n\n***Predator: Badlands*** debuted with $39.2 million overseas, for a great $79.2 million worldwide debut. Like the domestic market, it was the best ever debut for the franchise. The best debuts were in China ($7.4M), UK ($3.2M), Mexico ($2.3M), France ($1.8M) and Japan ($1.7M). China did not over-perform massively like ***Romulus***, but it wasn't expected to do that. From early signs, ***Predator: Badlands*** should easily hit $200 million worldwide, becoming the biggest film in the franchise.\n\n***Regretting You*** added $5.7 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $70.5 million. \n\n***Black Phone 2*** added $4 million overseas, for a $110 million worldwide total.\n\n***Bugonia*** seems to be showing some small power outside America. It added $3.6 million overseas, taking its worldwide total to $23 million. There's still lots of markets left.\n\n#**FILMS THAT ENDED THEIR RUN THIS WEEKEND**\n\nMovie | Release Date | Studio | Domestic Opening | Domestic Total | Worldwide Total | Budget |\n----------|----------|----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:\n*Weapons* | Aug/8 | Warner Bros. | $43,501,217 | $151,550,044 | $268,042,500 | $38M\n*The Strangers: Chapter 2* | Sep/26 | Lionsgate | $5,806,192 | $15,153,346 | $21,293,765 | $8.5M\n*After the Hunt* | Oct/10 | Amazon MGM | $1,529,394 | $3,258,830 | $7,093,629 | $70M-$80M\n\n- Zach Cregger's ***Weapons*** has closed with a fantastic $151 million domestically and $268 million worldwide, far above its $38 million budget. A huge win for original films, and further cementing Cregger as a box office draw (after all, this was sold on his name). Thanks to an incredible marketing campaign, the film was buoyed by great word of mouth (an \"A–\" on CinemaScore, not an easy feat for a horror). Now let's see how his ***Resident Evil*** version does next September.\n\n- Bravo, Renny Harlin. It takes talent to make ***The Strangers: Chapter 2*** fizzle out with just $21 million worldwide. A very underwhelming result, but it's hard to be surprised after the terrible reception to both ***Chapter 1*** and ***Chapter 2***. And there's still another film left to be released. The floor can get lower.\n\n- One of the year's biggest flops, Luca Guadagnino's ***After the Hunt*** has closed with a horrible $3.2 million domestically and $7 million worldwide. For some reason, this cost $70-$80 million, with $20 million going to star Julia Roberts. While the subject matter is challenging, the film's reception did not help it. Originally positioned as a possible Oscar contender, the film shocked many with its Venice premiere, where it earned weak reviews. All buzz went down, and the film vanished without a trace. It marked Guadagnino's latest box office disappointment, and he better hope that his next film fares much better.\n\n#**THIS WEEK**\n\nIt's a very busy week, with four films debuting in wide release.\n\nThe first is Paramount's ***The Running Man***, the new film from Edgar Wright. Based on the novel by Stephen King, it stars Glen Powell as a man who takes part in a dangerous game show where he must survive 30 days to win money. The trailers have emphasized action and the big scale of the game, which is very important in a blockbuster. Will that be enough to top the box office?\n\nThere's also the release of Lionsgate's ***Now You See Me: Now You Don't***, the third installment in the franchise. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher, and Morgan Freeman reprise their roles, and they're joined by Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa, Ariana Greenblatt, and Rosamund Pike. The franchise has been lucrative for Lionsgate; each film has made over $330 million worldwide. But the franchise halted 9 years ago, which is a long time to release a sequel. Will the audience still show up or they did just move on?\n\nNeon is also releasing Osgood Perkins' new horror film ***Keeper***, which stars Tatiana Maslany and Rossif Sutherland. Perkins is responsible for two of Neon's highest grossing films, ***Longlegs*** and ***The Monkey***, so he's riding on some good will with the audience. With ***Black Phone 2*** slowing down, could this be a main attraction for horror fans?\n\nAnd finally, A24 is releasing ***Eternity***, starring Miles Teller, Elizabeth Olsen, Callum Turner. The film follows a woman who must choose between two men with whom to spend eternity in the afterlife. Reviews have been positive since its TIFF premiere (85% on RT), so perhaps it could surprise.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1otsdh9/november_79_box_office_recap_predator_badlands/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1otsdh9/november_79_box_office_recap_predator_badlands/","score":88,"num_comments":29,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762814324.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/MlgIzOIAhujfbzxwOncT8J4_pKGz1TkH8woULT1v61Q.jpg"}

I might be biased because I’m a huge fan of both Ari Aster and Joaquin Phoenix. First, 2020 was an absolutely insane year and Eddington captured the feel of 2020 perfectly. The insanity, the anxiety, the constant events that keep piling up on top of each other, the sense of darkness of 2020 etc.\n\nThe commentary of corporations and having the movie end on the shot of the data center is perfection. The way that the characters were all in their own world of hatred and division while at the end, it basically shows how the mega rich get what they want at the end of the day anyway. It’s so nihilistic and perfect.\n\nAlso, Eddington is everything I love about cinema smashed into one film. I love dark comedies, I love westerns, I love political thrillers, I love dark/violent films, I love ominous music cues and a sense of dread, I love meta films, I love long films, and Joaquin Phoenix is my favorite actor. This film is literally all of those things smashed into one package. My favorite film of the year and I’m happy I was able to see it with an audience in theaters, my only complaint is that it wasn’t as long as Beau is Afraid lol.\n\nPeople criticize him a lot, but Ari Aster in my opinion is one of the most original directors working today and he’s one of my modern favorites!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ots703/eddington_is_fantastic_and_one_of_the_best_films/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1ots703/eddington_is_fantastic_and_one_of_the_best_films/","score":80,"num_comments":51,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762813891.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

{"id":"1otnetb","name":"t3_1otnetb","subreddit":"movies","author":"remus213","title":"The Others (2001) impresses me more and more each time I see it. I can't think of another film with twist ending that enhances re-watches. Knowing the ending almost completely changes the genre of the film.","selftext":"t’s always hard to pull off an effective twist ending that is both genuinely surprising and deeply satisfying in its execution. Either the twist is predictable, or only surprising for the sake of being surprising with previous scenes designed to mislead rather than foreshadow or make sense. It’s even harder to make a re-watchable film that centres on a twist ending.\n\nI just rewatched The Others (2001), and imo it’s a rare case of all these things and more - I wish it was talked about more. I first saw it when I was a child and liked it as a fairly typical haunted house gothic horror film, but I was focused on the ghost / scary aspect and therefore couldn't really appreciate it. I’ve seen it a few times since and have got more and more out of it each time. Now it’s one of my favourite films — not as a horror movie, but as what it reveals itself to be only after knowing the end: an incredibly sad and powerful tragedy about grief, loss and a mother coming to terms with a devastating truth.\n\nAfter you know that truth, the whole film changes and every single scene hits different with this framing. Moments that made you confused, suspicious or scared on the first watch become just devastatingly sad - people say it's a horror film and it was scary for me as a kid but over all my viewings it has made me cry far more than it made me scared. \n\nNicole Kidman's performance is amazing but can only truly be appreciated on second viewing. Every single scene takes on a completely different meaning with the framing of the ending and you start to notice all the subtle moments which foreshadow this in her performance. The scene where she describes limbo; she is literally on the verge of tears as she says \"pain forever\" - on first watch its interpreted as a strictly devout mother terrified of the idea of hell, but when you rewatch it you realise she’s describing her new reality — she’s in limbo, and she is terrified. \n\nAlso the score composed by the director himself is one of my all time favourites, rich and deeply emotionally evocative, moving and sad.  Its a way of hinting all along this is a tragedy rather than horror. When Grace is reunited with her husband Charles, the scene is accompanied with one of the saddest tracks in the whole score. What would usually be an uplifting moment of joy is instead given this deep mournful cello melody because this isn't a happy moment. It's Charles realising that his wife and children are dead and he is too. \n\nIn the scene where Grace does tell the children what happened the score is almost perfectly projected onto her words and emotions - it starts devastatingly sad as she realises that she killed her children. The score then rises into a tiny glimmer of hope as she says \"then I heard you playing with the pillows as if nothing had happened - ahh I thought the lord in his great mercy, was giving me another chance\". Just masterfully done - the track is called \"Good Mother\". That last scene is the best bit of acting by Nicole in anything and always moves me to tears. \n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1otnetb/the_others_2001_impresses_me_more_and_more_each/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1otnetb/the_others_2001_impresses_me_more_and_more_each/","score":39,"num_comments":31,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762803023.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":true,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"spoiler"}

{"id":"1ou5zpi","name":"t3_1ou5zpi","subreddit":"movies","author":"Hurdy_Gurdy_Man_84","title":"Freeway (1996) was a blast to watch.","selftext":"I went into Matthew Bright's **Freeway** *(1996)* knowing only about its main cast and that it was a modern-day retelling of the Red Riding Hood fable. I had seen **Guncrazy** *(1992)* which was written by Bright, so I could predict that Freeway also had similar aesthetic, such as \"trailer trash\" characters and social commentary on how the system is complicit in harassing the poor and downtrodden and keeping them down.\n\nI thought Guncrazy was just okay, nothing special. I thought it spent too much time in setting up the scenario and too little on the main story of two fugitives. However, Freeway proved to be a blast to watch from start to finish.\n\nThe cast is excellent and performed way better than I could predict. Reese Witherspoon is perfect as a teen from the poor white trash community, prone to emotional outbursts owing to her dysfunctional and abusive upbringing. This might just be her best acting performance ever. Kiefer Sutherland is also great as an outwardly normal and charming but unhinged killer.\n\nThe first half scenes in the car between Witherspoon and Sutherland where he takes her into his confidence and gradually reveals his ulterior motives to her, are a masterclass in building tension and anticipation. It's immensely satisfying to see the victim turn the tables on the villain.\n\nThe characters are multi-dimensional, as even though our sympathy is supposed to be with the heroine, we cannot help but feel a little repulsed by her due to some of her clearly criminal and remorseless actions in the second half; and conversely we also feel a little sorry (only a little) for the villain for what he suffers.\n\nThe social satire is also on point. We see how the protagonist suffers due to the apathy of the system and prejudice against her kind and how the same system views and rewards the antagonist as an upstanding citizen.\n\nSo, these are my thoughts on Freeway, which is *must recommended* to people who dig crime thrillers.\n\nAs a bonus, I will also write a few thoughts on the spiritual sequel **Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby** *(1999)*.\n\nLike Freeway, this one is also a modernized take on a fable - Hansel and Gretel this time. In many ways, this film is even more extreme and \"out there\" compared to Freeway. There is more nudity and sex and more depiction of perversions as well. However, simply being *more outrageous* does not automatically mean *better*. There are long stretches where nothing interesting happens. There is a \"trail of bread crumbs\" scene where crack cocaine is used instead of bread crumbs. If this reads as stupid to you now, it's 5x stupider to watch on screen. Whereas Reese Witherspoon was absolutely believable in her part in the first film, Natasha Lyonne here struggles embodying her character and comes across as trying hard to act like a white trash girl with a dead-end life but does not look credible in the least. Also, Vincent Gallo plays the \"witch\" who is also a cannibal cult leader. He should be entertaining on paper but the way he plays his character, he wears out the welcome really quick.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ou5zpi/freeway_1996_was_a_blast_to_watch/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1ou5zpi/freeway_1996_was_a_blast_to_watch/","score":4,"num_comments":7,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762856731.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Maybe what you recalled was more dramatic, maybe it was funnier, maybe it was more interesting or effective in getting a point across, maybe you thought it was making a point that it in fact wasn't making.\n\nIt can be about forgetting something, but it can also be about thinking that said thing was different to what it ultimately was. For example, you could misremember a film's ending as stopping on a pretty good final shot, but it turns out that the film keeps going after that and has a weaker denouement. \n\nI can think of one example, and sadly it's not a movie but a TV show. South Park has the episode \"Butters's Bottom Bitch\" and in it, there's a subplot about Officer Harrison Yates's hilariously overly committed yet obviously inept attempts at going undercover as a prostitute called Yolanda, one that works on several unwitting people. \n\nI had a memory of him, when revealing himself pulling out a gun and going \"FREEZE! I'M ACTUALLY A COP!\" and laughing at how funny it is that this very obvious undercover cop has to announce on the people he tricked that he's \"actually a cop\". Plus it just sounds funny to say that you're \"actually a X\"\n\nThen I rewatched the episode and sadly he doesn't say that, the closest at the end is when he goes \"I'M A COP!\".

Maybe y’all could help me? It’s in color, I’m assuming it was filmed later 50’s early-mid 60’s. There is a man who comes to town, he’s wearing all black or all white- he ha a gambler’s hat. His horse is black. There’s a gang that is terrorizing the town and the leader wants this girl, she’s like platinum blonde wearing a baby blue dress or a stripe blue and white dress, she’s super innocent. Her father might have been a bar owner or a tailor of the town but he’s quite timid. The town was so afraid they were willing to give her up.

But based on his actions throughout the film, this mindset doesn't make sense to me.   \nHe's particularly self-serving and narcissistic for a sociopath, telling her he's not going to stop his infidelity or his ways that she disapproves of and that it's her problem, and that she should just get over it. Not to mention, he has everything a person could ever want, and yet he seems to value his low-life \"stranger\" persona over his actual life and accomplishments.  \nAll the while showing absolutely no remorse or regret over abusing her or her friends, and acting patronizing and competitive to everyone he has a problem with. This all very much sounds like someone who is incapable of actually obsessing over losing control their family or marriage lifestyle.  Normally, someone like him would just find a new wife to control.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1ou03i1/in_the_film_enough_why_would_the_husband_insist/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1ou03i1/in_the_film_enough_why_would_the_husband_insist/","score":0,"num_comments":14,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762835175.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Question","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

One minute she's skipping around the Yellow Brick Road with the Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow and squealing about Toto, the next she's crying and screaming and having a full breakdown and this goes on for the entire movie. \n\nThe songs are Okay. Home is the standout but Diana Ross whimpers through the entire songbook and it gets annoying. Her whimpering and snuffling does work in one song, \"Is This What the Feeling Gets?\". I'm not the biggest Diana Ross fan but she sang this beautifully. \n\nCool production design, questionable costume design, Mabel King did a good job as Evillene. Nipsey Russell and Ted Ross were okay and I thought Michael Jackson was wonderful as the Scarecrow. He had a knack for acting that was never developed into movies. Pity!!!\n\nStill, I found the movie to be a bore and not all that entertaing because of Ross's shrill performance. This is one movie that could kill the career of its lead star and it did because she never made another feature film.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1oto9ci/the_wiz_1978_was_just_dreadful_and_diana_ross_was/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1oto9ci/the_wiz_1978_was_just_dreadful_and_diana_ross_was/","score":0,"num_comments":11,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762804880.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

{"id":"1otozkt","name":"t3_1otozkt","subreddit":"movies","author":"Kooky_Attention_850","title":"The Back to the Future Movies Would Be Lambasted by the Internet if They Came Out Today","selftext":"These two movies are just so easy to nitpick. The first movie already have a few logistical problems concerning its time travel rules, but it at least stuck to its rules. The next two movies simply ignore those rules when it is convenient, and the characters make some really dumb choices:\n\nBTTF Part II:\n\n1. Marty does not need to time travel in order to fix his destiny, he just had to be warned by Brown.\n2. Brown takes Jennifer to the future when it would have been easier to put her to sleep with that little device of his and take her home before leaving 1985.\n3. Brown and Marty leave Jennifer lying on the street in 2015 when it would have been smarter to just leave her in the car. I mean, most people would just assume the DeLorean is Jennifer's or her husband's or anything of the sort, so no one would have gotten suspiscious of seeing Jennifer unconsciouss in the car.\n4. When Marty was left in charge of looking over the time machine when Brown went to rescue Jennifer, Marty got distracted by a f\\*cking dog for some reason, and he did not hear the time machine being turned on as it was being stolen by Biff for some other reason (Marty is an idiot, so we can maybe let this slide).\n5. It is established in the first film that a rewrite of events that led to your existance in your relative past leads you to disappear from reality, but Marty and Brown do not disappear even if the past was changed, leading to the alternative 1985 and to the existence of alternate versions of themselves. A possible explanation would be that people do not just disappear automatically, it takes some time, but Future Biff did disappear from existence after he changed the past, and I also assume from the first film that people disappear sooner if they were born at a date closer to the change in the timeline, thus Marty and Brown should have disappeared before Biff.\n6. After Biff changes the past, the timeline should immediately diverge, making it impossible for Old Biff to return to the same 2015 Marty and Brown are in. Biff should have returned to an alternate future where Trump Biff ruled everything, or not returned at all, yet he somehow makes it back and conveniently disappears offscreen.\n\nBTTF Part III:\n\n1. Marty and Brown meet and then just stay in Hill Valley, with the impending threat of Buford Tanner shooting Brown, when they could just leave.\n2. That is all the nonsense here, or at least the major nonsense. Regardles, the film does have a few issues with the character of Clara. I have no idea why Brown just told Clara he was from the future without presenting any evidence, when the goddamn futuristic vehicle was RIGHT THERE! Oh, well, it is likely that Clara would not have believed him regardless, so I guess most people would let that slide. What I don't think people would stand is Clara's spernatural deduction abilities; she just looked at the model and guessed where Brown was. Also, a powerful finale to the saga that was in equal parts joyful and sad was butchered with super duper happy ending, with Brown just building a new time machine.\n\nDo these problems ruin the movies for me? Not really, but I can definetly understand if they ruin the movies for someone else. All I'm saying is that film YouTubers would have a field day nitpicking these flicks and tearing them apart. I can see YouTube thumbnails saying stuff like \"Back to the Future - Part II: A Loveable Disaster\", or \"Why Clara Does Not Work\", etcetera. These two guys in particular would be the spokesmen of the BTTF sequel haters:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f0x3ehionh0g1.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=7804707c3bf7a7f29492a977e5e66b4ec12b773c","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1otozkt/the_back_to_the_future_movies_would_be_lambasted/","permalink":"/r/movies/comments/1otozkt/the_back_to_the_future_movies_would_be_lambasted/","score":0,"num_comments":20,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762806481.0,"edited":1762843132.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/AzXYWWw9WnLwM0uVYhfjmAYHNHmPMYO11FL1o18hptU.jpg"}
