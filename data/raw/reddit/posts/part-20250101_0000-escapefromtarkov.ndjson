But now, after one week, I'm don't really want to keep playing.\n\nWhile I don't have real problems ith game itself, it even got better in some aspects, like queues was pretty fast for me (2-3 minutes), new questline is not bad and shooting feels fine, but PVP is just feels bad.\n\nFeel like every player knows best places for loot, all paths and corners. No new players looking for stuff, trying new things, only good players with 1000+ hours. And if I'm not playing optimally or be a rat, I just die without even putting a fight or seeing an enemy. And even if I enter a honest fight with someone, more often that not, i just die in few seconds after we see each other. It is either one bullet to the head or few bullets in the chest. I don't think I had 1 pvp fight this wipe, when I have to reload my mags or heal, not even worth mentioning using melee as last resort or look for other weapon on dead bodies in the middle of the fight, which was happeing to me before in early stages of wipe.   \n  \nThe fact the I see more squads than solo players also don't help. Before, even as a noob with less than 100 hours, with luck I could kill 3-4 players squad. And even if I died, I still could took few with me. It was rare, but memorable. Now, unless I'm being a complete rat, fighting squads is death sentence.\n\nAnd can't say that I encountered any cheaters, all players that killed me seemed legit, just a little (or a lot) better than me.

The skill ceiling keeps rising, and new players simply have no chance to learn the game when almost 70% of every match consists of players with 2,000+ hours.\n\nThis game needs proper matchmaking for early-level players, otherwise they will just quit. A few years ago Tarkov had no real competition. Now, if a new player gets destroyed 15 times in a row by 3k–8k-hour giga-chads, they will just switch to another game.\n\nWe need new players to stay, not to be farmed during their first week of 1.0.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1p66vlg/discussion_to_everyone_saying_my_start_was_rough/","permalink":"/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1p66vlg/discussion_to_everyone_saying_my_start_was_rough/","score":176,"num_comments":376,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764057919.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"PVP","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

[Discussion]","selftext":"Let me preface this by saying Shoreline is traditionally my favorite map....\n\nThis wipe has been an absolute nightmare on Shoreline like I have never experienced before. I like to PVP, and I don't hate battling shortly after getting into a raid. BUT Shoreline has been completely ridiculous with the spawns, and it's pretty sad. I've done 5 total raids attempting to stash the SV-98 (obtaining the SV this wipe has been a whole different issue I have with this game). Every raid, I have either taken shots, died, or killed someone else before getting through my first stamina bar. Personally, I find that ridiculous and feel it has no place in the game, even though it has historically been kind of similar. Combine this with the fact that Shoreline is littered with level 30+ players (that have access to quality ranged options) doing mid-game quests, and you've now created a map that nobody wants to touch pre-25.\n\n  \nSolutions? I have no idea. Less players? More building/POIs/cover in the vast landscapes on Shoreline? More roaming scavs to endanger stationary players? I don't know. But making the SV more difficult to get and Shoreline seemingly more deadly has to be one of the most thoughtless decisions in a pool of terrible decisions. I've already spent hundreds of thousands of roubles in previous wipes just purchasing it for the quest. Not being able to barter for it currently, and then searching in raid for one, and then finally getting it and immediately dying to some dude with an SVD and a Tac 30 and a 15KD isn't punishing, it's just a waste of time. \n\n  \nI have 2000 hours on a standard account, 4000 hours total. Almost 500 hours on Arena. I am a strong PVPer and have pretty amazing map sense. My survival rate @ level 20 is 71% with about 4 KD. This isn't a skill issue; this isn't an issue of disliking the grind, or an issue of being a casual. I don't think I shouldn't have to pander to joining a community discord where I can 5-stack into Shoreline so people aren't spawning 300ft away from me. I have never felt so optionless as a solo player in this game, and that's saying something. Highly doubt this will ever get changed, so I will probably end up finding the nearest bush to spawn and inflicting this same pain to others for the rest of the wipe.

I've also seen theories that they will also turn hostile if you aim at them.\n\n About 4 times this last week I have had instances where I'm running as my Scav and the NPC Scavs seemingly randomly turn on me. The run I just had that prompted this post went like this:  \nI killed 2 PMCs (confirmed in post game kill screen) in an isolated corner of Factory, no possible way a stray bullet went anywhere. I looted them, was loaded with gear & loot, headed towards exfil and came across probably 6 or 7 Scavs that had also killed a different PMC . They were all friendly, no issues at all, they most definitely saw me and aimed directly at me, walked right past me, and otherwise moved on. I meandered through the area towards exfil, suddenly I hear about 4 of them do voice-lines and they all turn towards me and start shooting. Ended up dying.\n\nMy Scav karma is neutral, I've been hyper conscious of where I'm shooting or even pointing my gun as a Scav, & I never saw/heard a boss or their guards. After this 4th time I asked my friend if he's noticed Scavs being super aggressive and he said he's had an identical series of experiences to mine.\n\nAm I missing new information about what triggers Scavs? Is there something else I can do to mitigate their wrath?

On the same map, sometimes I run at a smooth 90-120 FPS, sometimes It's 45-60. Sometimes there's horrible stuttering that makes it unplayable, with drops down to 5 fps out of nowhere and then it's either fine again in 2 minutes or stays like that for the rest of the day depending on the games fucking mood I guess. I've literally standardized my launch procedure for the game to try and figure this shit out. Restart PC, wait one minute for everything to settle down, force close all non essential programs, open launcher, clear cache, delete logs, launch. And it still feels like my experience is just randomized based on the time of day.\n\nI'm on the latest version windows 11, my nvidia drivers are updated with the hotfix thats supposed to fix the weird windows update performance issue (which seemingly worked, performance was much much worse before I did that). I run a manual malwarebytes scan every morning (automatic scan is turned off for performance), I'm never running anything in the background while playing, and my daily performance is still up to a coin toss every day and it's driving me fucking mad. I play on PVE and use BSG servers whenever available for the decreased CPU stress, but that doesn't seem to be the problem. Without BSG servers my fps is just lowered, I still have all the weird inconsistent performance issues.\n\nAs for tarkov settings, I have both automatic RAM cleaner and use only physical cores OFF, though I have tried changing both and they don't seem to solve the issue. I have no PostFX enabled, and most graphics settings are set to high because since tarkov is a product of the devil, doing that improves performance. If you think you can help me and need more info I will gladly screenshot every page of my settings menu and post that.\n\nI don't know what to do, I feel like I'm going crazy.
