I like playing Sage and I felt I was ok at it (Lvl 95) when I left but now its overwhelming and I cant keep up with some of these dungeon runs and keeping the tank healed. I dont know if its due to my long break or my brain just not able to comprehend things as well anymore but Ive looked up videos on easy controller setups for the rotations but even with that I struggle and I get a lot of rude comments. \n\nSo im asking if there is a group or Free Company that can help me get back into the flow?  Im on Crystal Zalera server.\n\nMy name on there is Little Helth.

{"id":"1p645zu","name":"t3_1p645zu","subreddit":"ffxiv","author":"LuxFrostrite","title":"Lost My account I’ve been playing since ARR due to poor security during the first few years of the game","selftext":"This story is a last ditch effort to recover an account I’ve been playing since ARR.\n\nI started the game at launch but was invest in other mmos at the time. So naturally I only subscribed when I was playing. I would take periodic breaks of a few months here and there. iirc during one of those breaks my account was compromised. I was able to recover it without issues. Little did I know that whoever hacked my account was able able to change the name of the account holder. At some point they upgraded their account security and forced all of use to get authenticators for the one-time password. So I registered an authenticator and linked it to my phone. \n\nAt some point I upgraded my phone and had to transfer authenticators. I don’t recall being told to jot down and keep safe a onetime authenticator removal password, so I was surprised when I found this was a requirement. I called customer service and found out that the name on the account didn’t match mine. I was surprised. Despite ID verification they stated they could not change the name of the account but could remove the authenticator one time as a free pass. I took down the appropriate removal code so I would hopefully be able to avoid this hiccup again\n\nFast forward to yesterday. I got a new phone and needed to transfer the authenticator. I found the instructions on the official website and followed them meticulously. I removed the old auth and began the process to register a new phone. According to the instructions i needed to scan a QR code. I did so and was able to register the authenticator on my account in mogstation. I was then instructed to download the app on my phone and follow the instructions in the app. I did so and it asked me for a onetime password. I went back to my browser and followed the prompts. Along the way it asked me to relog into my account and asked me for….you guessed it…a one time password.\n\nSo now I  officially locked out of my account and have no way of getting back in. To add insult to injury I can’t even log in to MogStation to cancel my subscription. I tried customer service and have hit a wall with them. This is a last resort. \n\nI’m at a loss, I don’t know how to process the loss of approximately 10 years of time ernergy and money invested in story, community, friends, mogstation items, fantasia, expansions, special edition upgrades etc….you get the idea\n\n\nI don’t know what to do, I feel like a part of me died today\n\n\n\n ","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1p645zu/lost_my_account_ive_been_playing_since_arr_due_to/","permalink":"/r/ffxiv/comments/1p645zu/lost_my_account_ive_been_playing_since_arr_due_to/","score":0,"num_comments":17,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764048068.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"[Tech Support]","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Unfortunately, my brother has SO much more time for this. In contrast, I am, what the kids call, “a filthy casual”. And so I need some help. I started out by going after cute outfits and good weapons (the weapon part was hard as shit), but I think there’s got to be a little more I can do. I don’t know what that is.\n\n1. Elden Ring and Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are my favorite combat games. What classes should I play? \n2. Am I really supposed to follow this yellow-traced square? (Ya’ll got a place you like to get hotbar layouts? A guide would be nice.)\n3. Is this Golden Saucer worth it?\n4. Is the PvP worth it? \n5. Is gathering worth it? Thinking of the reportedly “better” outfits… I don’t think that I could ever earn enough money for say, a house - but maybe I can make myself something nice?\n\nEdit: Thanks so far guys! I realize now forgot to mention the fact that it’s a hybrid build in Elden Ring.
