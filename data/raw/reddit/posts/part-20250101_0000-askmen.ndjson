My net worth is around $2M, I own a 2000 sq ft house, have a solid car, and work a high-paying but chill job in tech. I’m physically strong, go to the gym five days a week, have multiple outdoorsy hobbies, and I travel a lot. I’ve seen many countries and have built what looks like a great life from the outside.\n\nBut there’s one area where things never worked: dating. I’ve never found a soulmate. I haven’t even dated someone I genuinely liked for more than a date or two. My romantic experience overall is very limited. When I do meet someone I’m interested in, it usually ends immediately — they want to be just friends, or “the timing is bad,” or whatever version of “not interested” applies.\n\nBecause of that, everything else has started to feel hollow. I still do all the things I used to enjoy, but it’s mechanical now. I wake up sad, go through my day sad, and go to bed the same way. It’s hard to believe things will change for me, and losing that optimism has been the hardest part.\n\nTo be clear: I’m not in any danger and I don’t want to harm myself. I have friends, health, money, and stability. But without hope of finding a partner someday, I’m struggling to understand what I’m living for. That’s the part that scares me — the idea of feeling like this indefinitely.\n\nMy close friends know what I’m going through, and they want to help, but no one really has anyone they can introduce me to. I’m honestly out of ideas.\n\nFor the men here who were in a similar place — successful in most areas but really struggling with dating — what helped you? Did anything actually shift things for you, or did you find a different way to build meaning?\n\nEDIT:\n> ...why is every post written by AI these days?\n\nDisclaimer: I have used ChatGPT to proofread and improve the readability of my post and comments; English is my second language and languages have never been my strongest subjects.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1p632u2/men_who_are_successful_in_life_but_struggled_in/","permalink":"/r/AskMen/comments/1p632u2/men_who_are_successful_in_life_but_struggled_in/","score":402,"num_comments":144,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764044569.0,"edited":1764116915.0,"link_flair_text":"Existential post","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Then I start talking to new people and the cycle just repeats itself.\n\nJust to be clear: I have never stood anyone up on a date and I've always rain checked many days in advance.

{"id":"1p60ljb","name":"t3_1p60ljb","subreddit":"AskMen","author":"mrawesome989","title":"I (24M) have been struggling with my sexuality for a while and haven’t had any dating experience partly because of it. How do I get back to normal?","selftext":"\nI was always a shy and insecure person, didn’t date much in high school and thought it would be a problem in college. \n\nI started college during Covid and saw a few people were bisexual, I never thought about finding men attractive but decided to try jerking off to gay porn to see if I could force myself to form an attraction because I knew dating guys was much easier than girls and was desperate to have sex/date. \n\nJerking off to gay porn was difficult but eventually I was able to kind of enjoy it after forcing myself to only look at it for a while. \n\nIn college, I tried normal straight dating but didn’t get any matches. I also had grindr and got tons of attention on there. Freshman year I would frequently come over to gay/bi guys houses to give them head and sometimes let them fuck me. I didn’t really enjoy the acts themselves especially anal but I enjoyed the cuddling/intimacy even though it felt weird that it was with a guy. Guys thought it was weird that I would never get hard in front of them but didn’t think much of it and just let me bottom.\n\nSophomore/junior year I had straight friends that didn’t know I was doing this and thought I was straight, but I still jerked off to gay porn to “solidify” my gayness. I couldn’t get girls so I wanted to make sure I had another option. I was able to hook up with a girl one time after my friend helped me with DMing but I couldn’t even get hard because of all the porn. I would still go on grindr sometime during this period but much less frequently. \n\nI still have a habit of jerking off to gay porn because of my lack of dating success with girls. It’s much easier for me to jerk off to straight porn but every time I do I feel bad because I’m jerking off to something I’ll never experience in real life, whereas I’ve experienced gay sex many times and started associating it with pleasure. Jerking off to straight porn ruins my plan of converting myself which I’ve tried for 6 years at this point. \n\nI definitely still like girls and don’t know how I feel about guys but struggle accepting I’m not gay because I’ve tried to convert myself for so long. I haven’t hooked up with guys from grindr for a long time because I don’t really enjoy the experience, but I haven’t been able to hook up/date girls either and am just unfulfilled sexually. I’m not sure if it’s better for me to be unfulfilled or to hook up with a gender I’m not attracted to. I feel a lot of shame about what I did and don’t want the cost of what I did to be sunk. I don’t try to date girls as much anymore because of my age and my weird past. I’m sure if any girl knew she wouldn’t be able to get past it. \n\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1p60ljb/i_24m_have_been_struggling_with_my_sexuality_for/","permalink":"/r/AskMen/comments/1p60ljb/i_24m_have_been_struggling_with_my_sexuality_for/","score":0,"num_comments":14,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764037275.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Existential post","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I’ve been trying to improve things little by little like working out more consistently and fixing small habits and forcing myself to show up even on the days where I don’t feel like talking to anyone. I’m handling responsibilities I used to avoid, keeping my space cleaner, being more present, just trying to actually be a better version of myself but there’s this quiet frustration that keeps creeping in because it feels like none of it matters to anyone but me. I know you’re not supposed to depend on outside validation and I get that but sometimes it hits harder than I expect when I realize none of the people around me see any of the progress I’m making. Not friends, not family, nobody. It’s like I’m doing all this internal work in complete silence and the world just keeps moving like nothing changed and it’s strange because I am proud of myself in a way I haven’t been before but at the same time there’s this weird emptiness when you’re growing alone and nobody notices the effort or the discipline or the small wins that nobody else sees. I guess I’m just wondering how other guys deal with that feeling without letting it drain their motivation or make them feel like what they’re doing doesn’t matter.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1p6ef9a/guys_how_do_you_deal_with_feeling_unappreciated/","permalink":"/r/AskMen/comments/1p6ef9a/guys_how_do_you_deal_with_feeling_unappreciated/","score":0,"num_comments":13,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764082352.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"🛑 Answers From Men Only 🛑","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
