{"id":"1p63b21","name":"t3_1p63b21","subreddit":"Home","author":"danicabrooksy","title":"Fire alarm issues in student rental house","selftext":"Hi everyone, \n\nI need help. My roommates and I (19, 19, 19 & 20) are renting our first student house. We live in Ontario Canada. We didn't live here full time in the summer but we've had issues with the fire alarms since the summer. \nSo - we came to hang out for a weekend in the summer. When we got into the house the main floor fire alarm was chirping every 30 seconds because of dead batteries. They are hardwired into the house but they chirp even when the backup batteries are dead. We texted the landlord and he wasn't able to come help, so he instructed us that it was okay to unplug and replace the battery ourselves. \nThen, when we all moved in and started school, the upstairs fire alarm did the same thing. We messaged the landlord again and he determined that they needed to be replaced anyways, it was time. \nWe got them replaced and had maybe a month of peace. \nThey started randomly alarming for about 5 seconds at a time, the main floor one first and then the upstairs one would follow, and then they would both stop on their own. It was an actual alarm too - as if there was a fire, but there wasn't. At first it was unpredictable and we would go days or weeks without hearing anything. Just this weekend that changed - they were doing the same thing again, but more frequent and late into the night. \nI messaged the landlord and he came and replaced the downstairs one again. We saw no reason for it to be going off - it would alarm when no one was cooking/baking, showering, no candles were burning, no power outages had happened, no dust/bugs near the alarms, etc. So the only solution was to replace it and see what happens. \nHe did that at 11am today, and at 5pm they did the same thing AGAIN. \nThey are carbon monoxide and smoke detectors, they speak when there's an emergency - they didn't speak when they went off. Literally the same thing that was happening before happened again. This time, I noticed that when the alarm was replaced, a \"Power\" light on it was green, and since it's gone off it's blinking red. It's a FirstAlert alarm and I figured maybe they're supposed to blink red to indicate that it's powered? But if the light was green....\nCan someone tell us if we're crazy? Is the wiring of the house faulty?? Is there something we can do?? \nWe may have to unplug it to stop the beeping but we're not comfortable doing that! Someone please help!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Home/comments/1p63b21/fire_alarm_issues_in_student_rental_house/","permalink":"/r/Home/comments/1p63b21/fire_alarm_issues_in_student_rental_house/","score":1,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764045306.0,"edited":false,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I've added weather stripping to the rickety barn doors in the back and redid the weather stripping on the two garage doors and the side human door up front. \n\nThe garage doors seal a bit, but it takes wind head on. I saw these hinges on a DIY YouTube channel and thought they could help. They're spring loaded so the push the roller against the track and the door panel out against the wind. \n\nAnyone have any experience with them? Do they work? \n\nI have a FLIR One camera that I just got, and will be looking for additional air gaps with it, but I KNOW the garage doors still don't seal at the sides halfway down and lower, especially in wind. \n\nAdditionally, any other advice on insulating my garage? It was built in the 40s or 50s. \n\nSo far I've done: \n+Weather stripping doors\n+Spray foam in gaps between roof and wall\n+Insulation board over the upper non -closable louver window thing at the workshop end\n+Foam strips on inside of barn door to further seal gaps (it's old and not very tight fitting)\n\nMy plan is to get it insulated well enough that I can run the heater when I'm out there working every few days and it won't dip below freezing. Eventually I'll put in a mini split, but I've got to save up for that.
