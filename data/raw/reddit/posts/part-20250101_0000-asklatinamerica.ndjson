I am wondering what you believe is the 'friendliest' country in Latin America? This could be where people are most 'open', where greeting and saying goodbye is very valued, and small talk is common - or however you define 'friendliest'.\n\nIn my travels, I have found people to be vveeerryy friendly in Mexico and Colombia, and quite friendly in Peru. I often read about how friendly people are in Brasil, but I have not found that to be the case at all! Panama is another Latin American country where I didn't experience an overt 'friendliness'.\n\nWhat about you all?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/1otq90z/what_do_you_believe_is_the_friendliest_country_in/","permalink":"/r/asklatinamerica/comments/1otq90z/what_do_you_believe_is_the_friendliest_country_in/","score":58,"num_comments":219,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762809326.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"r/asklatinamerica Opinion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Visited Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil and now Peru, and I am curious about how latinos see each other, and wich are they favorite and least favorite country except their own to travel.\n\nThe thing that most surprised me in my trip is how underrated is Peru. The culture is so unique, food is the best by far (ok, maybe with Mexico) and I felt very safe and chill there. Tourist infrastructure is fantastic and people are very honest and never try to scam you, unlike Colombia where I got robbed AND scammed lol\n\nI also really loved Brazil and Mexico, also because of the authenticity and how happy and vibrant the countries are, and how beautiful and playfull people are in Brazil.\n\nOverall, great experience and I am now obsessed about LatAm and I will definitely go back to Peru","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/asklatinamerica/comments/1ottwz5/what_are_your_experiences_travelling_to_other/","permalink":"/r/asklatinamerica/comments/1ottwz5/what_are_your_experiences_travelling_to_other/","score":12,"num_comments":32,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762818037.0,"edited":1762818354.0,"link_flair_text":"Tourism","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
