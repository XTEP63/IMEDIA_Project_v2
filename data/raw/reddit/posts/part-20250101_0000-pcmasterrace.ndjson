No toys just monies for skins and in-game trainers? They pay for trainers to level multiple accounts, I asked why have more then one game account? They said if they get caught hacking they just use another one, I asked why are you hacking / aimbots in-game? Apparently all their friends do it too so it's like a status who can get the highest rank in Marvel Rivals for example. They showed me how easy it was to download a aimbot hack for Marvel Rivals through Discord, even though the game has anti-tamper protections at the BIOS level, I was actually impressed it didn't get shut-down instantly by the game. You can adjust the hit rate of the aimbot so not 100% or you get detected easier, you can even toggle it on/off in-game using shortcut key on mouse. Apparently alot of high profile streamers use these methods to generate more views and create 'get good' tutorials. \n\nSo by the sounds of it kids aren't gaming like I did back in the day anymore, they pay for hacks, trainers, high rank comp accounts, latest skins and stream acting like they did it all solo. In my old mind I feel like the skins are a waste of money as you don't really see them playing but your opponents do and 9/10 it makes you easier to spot. In my day you could mod skins yourself or just get some for free on Nexus Mods for example, apparently it's a show-off status thing and not for yourself. Looks like online comp games just boils down to who has the better (more expensive) hacks. \n\nIt's kinda sad how the kids are gaming like a chore more then a relaxation period. If they don't do what their friends are doing they get left out and blamed if their team loses by not hacking. Weird times.

I can only use onboard AMD one.\n* I assumed it was a seating issue, so I powered off, opened the case, and tried to unplug the cable.\n\nThen.\n\n* The 16-pin adapter will not come out of the GPU at all.\n* It is fully seated – latch engaged, no obvious misalignment.\n* On top of the connector, I can see two distinct burn marks on the plastic.\n* On the GPU side of the socket, on the shroud/edge next to the slot, there’s a linear burn mark that lines up perfectly with the plug.\n* It genuinely looks like the plug and socket have heat-welded together. No amount of reasonable pressure + latch pressing will move it, and I don’t want to rip the socket off the PCB.\n\nI’ve shut everything down, PSU is off and unplugged, but that is about it. Trying to survive this mental damage 5090 gave me this year (first one RMA'd due to artifact, this is a replacement)\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. For MSI owners who went through RMA for this kind of issue, did you ship the card with the adapter still stuck in it, or did support demand you pull it out first?\n2. Should I also loop in Seasonic, or is this basically “GPU + adapter RMA” territory?\n\nRight now, my plan is to open an MSI ticket with these photos and ask if I can send the card in as-is. I am not sure if I should return Seasonic or not. Also, wanted to document this here in case others are seeing the same thing on 50-series, and to hear what MSI did for you if you’ve been through this.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p67ww2","permalink":"/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1p67ww2/msi_5090_adapter_looks_welded_to_the_card_melted/","score":1011,"num_comments":166,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764062005.0,"edited":1764062474.0,"link_flair_text":"Tech Support","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/BO0r3u1ZUsjMKEvnblYVcYbgKGlDX5F0ha2L6Zcjzw8.jpg"}

I haven't touched windows in a long time (other than school) but I haven't gone through a windows 11 installation, and I have seen People say that you have to do a bypass using cmd and its a lot more complicated than linux. I have also seen that you have to buy windows to get a watermark off the corner of the screen. So I need some advice on really anything. I am going to be video calling her once she gets all the parts and doing the installation so I need a little bit of help navigating her through the installation process. I am confident in navigating her through the build process but the installation process is a little bit different and I don't want her to mess up somewhere and get stuck trying to install windows.

Everytime i boot the game (rivals) SR OVR defaults to  “off” even though its turned to “latest” in the nvidia app. I have to manually change the model preset to something else then back to “latest” for the override to work. I thought it was a game issue so i reinstalled it and used DDU for the drivers. (Even tried older versions). The game still does not recognize my changes and defaults to SR OVR “off” which i believe is dlss 3 (looks pretty bad) and i still have to manually change it twice on the app whenever i boot the game. Im not sure if its a game or driver issue anymore and would appreciate if anyone can help troubleshoot.

I’m looking for a pre-built for Black Friday to replace my start of covid era budget build.
