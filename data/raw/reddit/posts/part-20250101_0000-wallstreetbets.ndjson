{"id":"1p6c4tx","name":"t3_1p6c4tx","subreddit":"wallstreetbets","author":"JulianHabekost","title":"Calculating the Strategy/MSTR Ponzi-Ratio Curve","selftext":"https://preview.redd.it/dljv2g3t9e3g1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d88408b1fd0f3f97ead34073367958e2b6a6fbd5\n\n# We called it nine months ago\n\nRecap: Strategy (former MicroStrategy) finances Bitcoin Acquisitions with \"preferred stocks\" that are marketed looking like bonds with planned fixed dividends. Michael Saylor (Strategy CEO) also \"promises\" to never sell Bitcoin. This means that dividends can only be paid by raising more money from new investors. If this was secret it would be called a ponzi scheme, maybe the fact that it's clearly written down in the 8-K filings to the SEC makes this totally fine 🤡\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zz9nc2wf5e3g1.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=623ccfd846819b6e8ea7c90ad49baf0874717e9b\n\nThe reception to the post was overwhelmingly positive; also most people called it obvious, \"everyone knows this, timing is the issue!\" [Maybe everyone except this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p3i7c4/its_over_for_me/), but yeah. I'm a bit sorry for the guy, but hey he is looking for a regular job now, welcome to the world of people with regular jobs.\n\nIn contrast, the media seemed to be quiet back then; until basically now, now that the MSTR price does look grim. Now also indices are considering to ban Strategy and the like, but it feels a little bit like the Michael Burry moment where the banks are finally valuating the credit swaps in his favor...\n\nThe comments in that post were a Big Short meme fest, emphasizing the difficulty of the correct timing, not just the correct call in general. This is part of the inspiration for the calculation that I will show you now. It won't solve this issue, but it will give it some refinement.\n\n# The Strategy/MSTR Ponzi-Ratio Curve\n\nThe question that I am asking here is: How much of the money raised is spent on BTC and how much is spent (or promised) on preferred stock dividends (the instruments used to raise the money)? Put this in a fraction and plot its trajectory over time, I present to you: the ponzi ratio curve! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bx6118tv9e3g1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=f97e2009e4f71f9f2dcd63472169f5705237410f\n\nTo do this I have normalized everything to daily values. The actual dividend payments are quarterly, the BTC acquisitions and preferred stock issuances are mostly weekly. Currently Strategy promises dividends of \\~700M$ yearly, so every day almost 2M$. (Note that at the time of my first post only STRK existed. Now there are five different versions of preferred stock that are used to cross finance each other, etc. I'd say it's a mechanism to find out how to cause the maximum confusion.) So the blue curves track the issuance volume of those preferred shares but they just show the resulting promised dividends.\n\nNote: Some money is also raised through diluting MSTR main shares. This is pictured here only as part of the BTC acquisitions. MSTR/A does not pay dividends so its not part of the blue curves.\n\n# Okay but what does that mean?\n\nMore money for past investors, less for BTC. But you have to know, the promised fixed dividends, they are just that, promised. They look like a fixed coupon but they can simply decide not to pay them.\n\nMy hypothesis for an end game scenario is: Once Strategy decides they do not pay dividends, their ability to raise any new money will end abpruptly. Without the ability to buy new BTC, their \"business model\" is dead. MSTR is not celebrated for having bitcoin, it is celebrated for buying bitcoin and pumping the price. The moment they just sit on this pile of bitcoin that doesn't generate any dividends while their fund raising stalls is the moment where people will realize that you need to also be able to sell an asset that you borrow against. If Kim Jong-un stole the Mona Lisa and hung it over his bed in Pyongyang, Morgan Stanley woud flip him the bird if he wanted to borrow some money against it. Because he can't sell it (to anyone with actual money), even though he might be the legal owner under North Korean law. Saylor did not steal the bitcoin, but he promised to never sell it. He said nothing is more worth than bitcoin, you never sell your bitcoin, yada, yada. So just by keeping his promise he can't sell; but even if he breaks it: What do you think will happen to the bitcoin price if its biggest advocate (and holder of 3%) decides that: \"Now actually yeah, now is a good moment to sell your bictoin\".\n\nSo I am seeing a mexican standoff between Strategy and BTC. Strategy will simply try to wait it out, but the risk is that people sell their bitcoin before Strategy is forced to. Because Strategy has actual debt and can actually go bancrupt. We're probably speaking of 10k$-ish BTC, you have to decide how likely that is and how aware the crypto community will be of the trojan ponzi time bomb that Strategy gifted them.\n\n# Technical Stuff an Disclaimer\n\nI partly vibe coded this. I used ChatGPT-API to read out 8-K filings to get the preferred stock issuance timeline. Some numbers don't agree exactly with their dashbord on the website, but it's close enough that it shouldn't disturb the picture. But please double check everything yourself, here is the code that I used:\n\n[Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZH6ZnhrOf-QJ3T7s1Pxax1uc97fWazEU/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# My Position\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmqfx7l2le3g1.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebaf560113140127b86364364ac57cb7a316149e\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p6c4tx/calculating_the_strategymstr_ponziratio_curve/","permalink":"/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1p6c4tx/calculating_the_strategymstr_ponziratio_curve/","score":118,"num_comments":110,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764076508.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"DD","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/L-2lETHhzFGQlyfREaP4Vspk06daVdhrQj3Nq3_dV84.jpg"}
