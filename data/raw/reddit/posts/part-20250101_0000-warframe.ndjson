You are free to do what you will with the cards I've designed, but know that whatever broken things you end up doing are entirely on you.**\n\nMy goals for each deck\n\n1. Create a slower combat focused environment. This does not mean that I don't want to design combo wins, I just want a combo win to be hard earned. I am\n2. Build each card around one to two iconic aspects of the subject featured in each card. In the case of Saga cards, each chapter has to correspond to the beginning, middle, and end of the story/quest.\n3. Strike a balance between flavor and playability, slightly favoring the side of playability.\n4. Try to limit complexity to a level wherein new players can easily understand each card.\n5. Have fun. I'm doing this to keep myself entertained during breaks or while I'm stuck in traffic. Mistakes will be made, no biggie. We learn, change, and move on!\n\n\n\n**How to build the deck**\n\n  \nHave the cards printed out, and replace every single card in the \"PH CARDS\" category with the custom cards. Each deck will be mostly made up of custom cards, with the landbase, and a few existing MTG cards to flesh the deck out. I'll try to keep each list <=$50US to make the barrier to entry low.\n\n  \n[Google Drive <----THE REST OF THE CARDS ARE HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16X7KjCTcpXC4rW2vSgpcCGrGaHampZxP)\n\n[Archidekt <---- THE DECK LIST IS HERE](https://archidekt.com/decks/17678874/the_grineer_empire)\n\n  \nI hope you guys enjoy these cards, if not, then feel free to downvote! I welcome all constructive criticism!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p62g6b","permalink":"/r/Warframe/comments/1p62g6b/the_grineer_empire_a_fanmade_warframe_themed_mtg/","score":63,"num_comments":14,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764042631.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Fluff","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ztZNDd4FTJVMk1vgyDpQecmCW7aJmYz7J9aQyuMlZQw.jpg"}

So, I just combed through the Warframe Wiki for info on all the mods that keep on getting mentioned and/or are appealing to me.  \nApart from this, there are also some basic mods in the game, like for example Pathogen Rounds or Hellfire, that are deceptively hard to acquire. I'm a month in and just want Heat on my rifles goddamnit...\n\nThat being said, this is more of a personal check list, mostly mods that I think I'll need. I'm 100% positive I forgot or perhaps omitted something, because I already acquired it.  \nMaybe you can help out, if you feel something important is missing.\n\nSo here goes a list of locations and stuffs to do to get mods while progressing through the game, more or less in order of importance:\n\n# ACTIVE FARMS\n\nGet there and do stuff.\n\n=== From **CHIPPER**, Kahl's Garrison (after Veilbreaker)\n\n* *Archon mods*\n\nLate game stuff, but obviously mandatory...\n\n=== From **ARBITRATIONS**:\n\n* *Galvanized mods*\n* *Adaptation*\n* *Preparation*\n* *Rolling Guard*\n* *Combat Discipline*\n\nSimilar to Archon mods, absolute no-brainers...\n\n*Legend:*\n\n* *Tier 1: Earth, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Phobos, Ceres*\n* *Tier 2: Jupiter, Europa, Saturn*\n* *Tier 3: Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, Sedna*\n\n*The letters A/B/C refer to which rotation/vault contains the reward in question. A is the first and second, B the third and C the fourth. Then the cycle repeats. In Spy missions, C refers to successfully opening all three vaults.*\n\n=== From **DARK SECTOR DEFENSE** missions:\n\n* *Barrel Diffusion (C, also Grustrag Three)*\n* *Hellfire (C, also Ambulas on Hades, Pluto)*\n* *Vital Sense (B, also Oestrus, Eris C)*\n* *Ravage (B, also lower tier defense C)*\n* *Quickening (Tier 1/2 C)*\n\nThese super basic mods shouldn't be so hard to get, but here we are...\n\n=== From **SPY** missions:\n\n* Tier 1 C:\n   * *Vicious Frost*\n   * *Volcanic Edge*\n* Tier 2/Lua C:\n   * *Rime Rounds*\n   * *Scattering Inferno*\n* Tier 3 C or Kuva Fortress Spy B:\n   * *Frigid Blast*\n   * *Frostbite*\n   * *Scorch*\n   * *Thermite Rounds*\n   * *Power Throw*\n\nBanger mods. I don't like Spy too much, which is probably also why I don't have any of these mods. Guess I have to get used to the layouts and slog through. I just wished I had Ash, imo the least boring invis frame. ;\\_\\_;\n\n=== From **NIGHTMARE** missions:\n\n* Tier 1:\n   * *Blaze*\n   * *Hammer Shot*\n   * *Chilling Reload*\n   * *Ice Storm*\n   * *Stunning Speed*\n   * *Wildfire*\n   * *Accelerated Blast*\n* Tier 2:\n   * *Drifting Contact*\n   * *Shred*\n   * *Armored Agility*\n* Tier 3:\n   * *Lethal Torrent*\n   * *Constitution*\n   * *Vigor*\n\nOnly when I compiled this list did it occur to me how good Nightmare mission rewards are. If only we beginners could unlock Nightmare mode by just completing the base nodes on a planet instead of having to guess which quests have hidden nodes...\n\n=== From **BOUNTIES**:\n\n* Cetus:\n   * *Gladiator set (20-40 or 30-50)*\n   * *Augur set (30-50)*\n* Fortuna:\n   * *Synth Deconstruct (20-40)*\n* Necralisk:\n   * *Status chance on cast mods (15-25)*\n   * *Crit damage on aim mods (15-25)*\n   * *Fire Rate on aim mods (15-25)*\n   * *Weeping Wounds (15-25)*\n   * *Crit chance on aim mods (30-40)*\n   * *Blood Rush (30-40*)\n\nMaybe these mods are kinda niche, but they are also something to aim for while working on getting standings to Rank 3 for the Bond mods.\n\n=== From **DRAGON VAULTS** on Deimos:\n\n* *Corrupted mods*\n\nThere are sooo many of these and the RNG can get annoying real quick. I'm just thankful there are lots of public squads regularly running Deimos Capture.\n\n=== From **CORRUPTED VOR** on lvl 40+ Void missions:\n\n* *60/60 Toxic mods*\n\nAnother super important set of mods.\n\n=== From defeating **SILVER GROVE** specters:\n\n* Via Sunrise Apothic\n   * *Shotgun Amp*\n* Via Nightfall Apothic:\n   * *Pistol Amp*\n   * *Growing Power*\n* Via Twilight Apothic:\n   * *Brief Respite*\n   * *Stand Unite*d\n\nThis can get annoying really quick. I suggest keeping an eye out for plants while doing other stuff in locations where they grow. Because these mods really aren't too shabby.\n\n=== From **JUNO SAPPER MOA** on Brutus, Uranus:\n\n* *Cannonade mods*\n* *Elementalist mods*\n\nHaven't tried this yet, but I like me some good mods in a single location.\n\n=== From **THE CIRCUIT:**\n\n* *Condition Overload*\n* *Berserker Fury*\n* *Healing Return*\n* *Rage*\n* *Spring-Loaded Blade*\n\nI don't know what the hell goes on in Duviri and the drop rates look absolutely abysmal. But Condition Overload is quite obviously the king of melee mods...\n\n=== From **SCALDRA** enemies in Höllvania:\n\n* *Merciless Gunfight*\n* *Worthy Comradery*\n* *Primary Acuity*\n* *Summoner's Wrath*\n* *Spectral Serration*\n\nNo clue what's up with this, but the mods look cool.\n\n=== From **THERMIA FRACTURES** and **ROPALOLYST**, Jupiter:\n\n* *Amalgam mods*\n\nThese don't seem too important, so I wouldn't break a sweat unless aiming specifically for one of the augments.\n\n=== From **THE INDEX**:\n\n* *Some odd weapon augments*\n* *Shield Charger*\n\nKinda meh, but ok.\n\n=== From **PUZZLE ROOMS** on Lua:\n\n* *Drift mods*\n\nThey look interesting, but also not too important.

{"id":"1p659kd","name":"t3_1p659kd","subreddit":"Warframe","author":"illusion_Y","title":"The Music in this Game","selftext":"SPOILERS FOR THE SECOND DREAM, THE SACRIFICE, AND JADE SHADOWS:  \n  \nAfter clocking 3k hours in this game 3 years ago, I got burn out and stopped playing this game. Yet, I always return for the quests and the Warframe storylines, specifically because of the quests and the music. Since I stopped playing Warframe I have played many games but few come to the caliber of story telling that  DE has. One thing that DE does in their quests is incorporating music into the storytelling and not just have it be a way to \"set the mood\". It's more than just leitmotifs that other games have done and continue to do.  \n  \nFor example, the \"This is what you are\" song already makes sense for someone who has little experience with music OST's and leitmotifs; a central adult female vocalist followed by a choir of kids that harmonize with her, which represent the Lotus and the Tenno with her. And then other renditions of the song also tell how the story is progressing between the Lotus and Tenno. Somewhere in the apostasy prologue, a rendition of \"This is what you are\" is played but without the adult female vocalist, aka without the Lotus, and the choir of kids are out of tune with one another, showing that the Tenno are \"lost\".   \n  \nIn the Sacrifice quest, early on the quest establishes the existence of a song with emotional ties to both the Dax soldier and his son, \"Smiles from Juran\". For most of the quest, we do not actually hear the song. Most other games I have played would play the song for you early on in the quest so that they could use the song later at emotional moments, yet DE did it differently. They tell you that the Shawzin is the instrument on which the song is played, yet, as a player who is not familiar with the in-universe terms, what is a Shawzin? Is it our equivalent of flute, trombone, violine, piano, etc.? So what DE did is they had you look at a Shawzin and established that it looked like a guitar, so, it probably sounds like one. And since the Dax soldier is not a musician, the song is probably a simple one. They gave you all these clues so that when the song does eventually play in the most critical moment of the quest, you as the player have enough hints to peace together that the song playing in the background is indeed \"Smiles from Juran\". The Sacrifice is not my favorite quest, but I am yet to see a game pull of something like this, of which I am grateful to have played the Sacrifice.  \n  \nIn Jade Shadows, the song, \"Final Ascent\" tells alot just by listening to it on YouTube, but in the quest you would not really stop to think about the leitmotifs of the song (assuming you are familiar with them in the first place). Yet, this song tells alot in-game (without careful listening) and tells a lot about Jade without actually meeting her. In the elevator sequence, hearing this song, with the female vocals (representing Jade), and with Stalker's new green color, hints towards how as if Jade gave the Stalker her blessing and has full trust in the Stalker to protect the child, despite her (probably) realizing that the Stalker's mind is very corrupted. After the elevator sequence, where the Corpus are shooting at the stalker and the baby, the instruments get lower and the female vocalist dominates the soundscape, and the Stalker using his scythe to stand again after being shot in the leg, showing how the Stalker indeed is continuing in the mission that Jade has purposed herself into and that he indeed is worthy of her trust and her power. The Jade Shadows quest is the only piece of video game media that has ever made me cry. In fact, I have cried played the quest a total of three times and cried all three times.   \n  \nEven though I may not enjoy playing this game anymore in terms of gameplay, I will still come back for the quests and DE's storytelling and music. If anyone has any other suggestions of games that also use music as another media of storytelling do let me know!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1p659kd/the_music_in_this_game/","permalink":"/r/Warframe/comments/1p659kd/the_music_in_this_game/","score":13,"num_comments":5,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764051889.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":true,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"spoiler"}
{"id":"1p6haor","name":"t3_1p6haor","subreddit":"Warframe","author":"Dregor_Richards","title":"The Quest For... Gyre","selftext":"**TLDR:** It's all just random, I'm just ranting about how cool and elaborate it is to build a custom Amp to harvest Gyre resources.\n\n\n\nI don't think this warrants a spoiler tag, I'm not really going to be touching on any lore, but it's my first post, so if I got that wrong, I'll throw on the spoiler tag.  \nI've played some 600+ hours of Warframe at this point, and I just wanted to recount my most recent endeavors, because it's only so often that a \"quest\" in this game feels... This in-depth. And I don't mean a narrative quest, I mean the steps that have occurred in my efforts to collect and construct all of the pieces of Gyre...\n\nSo, I had tried to acquire Gyre before, but the repetition of bounties (and my lack of powerful builds in years past) had slowed those efforts. Having acquired all but 10 or so of the Warframes in the game, however, I decided to return to the Zariman. Thus does this quest begin like many Warframe acquisition quests, with some single-stage bounties that have a chance of rewarding the pieces and the main blueprint. As I run through these bounties, however, I denote a single ingredent that appears to be far too sparse for its demand in these blueprints... Thrax Plasm. At the beginning, I figured the low chance of acquiring the blueprints would level that out, but as I acquired one, then two... Ultimately all of the blueprints, I possessed only 200 of the thousand that was demanded for this construction plan. Alright, easy enough, I'll do some endless mission for the ingredient.  \n  \nAt this point, I ask the chat for the best mission to do such, and I'm pointed to Void Cascade, where I figured I would steadily acquire all that was needed... And mayhap I could have, for the first mission starts out well enough, I get the hang of the unique mission rules, and I find that... The operator is essential. At this point, I hold only the Sirocco for my operator weapon, which was rendered all but useless by the fifth wave of the mission, greatly delaying my ability to harvest the necessary Plasms, and eventually forcing my retreat. Now, I could have just repeated the mission, going to the fourth wave and then retreating over and over, getting roughly 30-40 Plasms per run... But I'm glad I didn't.  \n  \nSome quick math reveals that at that rate, I'll have to repeat the mission some 20 times just to get the components... When instead, I could assemble a stronger Amp, and return with strength better matched against these Void creatures. Surely assembling an Amp (Something I hadn't bothered with up to this point) couldn't be too difficult?  \nThe first stop is Onkko, for I recall briefly seeing that he sold pieces to Amps... And it is there that I am able to assemble a preview of the weapon I want, made up of three components:  \nThe Rahn Prism  \nThe Phahd Scaffold  \nThe Suo Brace  \nAs it so turned out, I had already acquired the blueprint for the Brace. But, this is where the real quest begins.\n\nFor the Prism and Scaffold, I need to rank up twice with the Quills to even acquire the blueprints, so I use up my daily standing, save a snapshot of the crafting ingredients for each component, and take note of a foreign item that I need for ranking up... Eidolon Shards. I don't have any, and I'm not entirely sure that I've ever acquired any before, but it is of little import, because first, I must venture to Fortuna, where the ingredients for the Brace await...  \n  \nI already possess spare gemstones, but a trio of ingredients may prove more difficult... Longwinders apparently only swim in the warmed moments of Venus, that haunting Orokin device providing me only a six-minute window in which to acquire these fish-like creatures. So while I wait for the cold-front to dissipate, I make headway to the Temple Of Profit, where I can find the Toroids I seek. For the first cycle, I find luck is not on my side, and before long, I'm departing for a decent fishing spot; there, I find Longwinders can not extremely common even during that five-minute window, but I catch half of the fish that I require, before the freezing winds return, and sends the rest of the metal-scaled creatures into the depths once more. From there, I return to Fortuna, to see about the \"Repeller System\" that will be required. As it turns out, such a device can be found by undertaking a high-level operation... That demands a max-ranked standing with Solaris United, a faction that I had formerly left an entire rank below such. 99,000 standing is more than I can acquire in a single day, but I confer with Ticker all the same, to pay off some unlucky fellows who find themselves in debt, and then head back into the Vallis for a few Narmer bounties (Assuming that I will need to aid Vox Solaris before this quest is finished, the Narmer devices may offer further standing), while I await the coming warm cycle. It is in-between these bounties, that I happen to find myself back upon the surface of the Temple of Profit, and luck was graceful this time... I manage to acquire the first duo that I will need, of Sola Toroids. The warm cycle then spikes, and a familiar return to my fishing spot provides the final Longwinders that will be of essential use. Having acquired what standing I can for the day, and seeing that without ranking up, I'll need to return anyways, I leave the final Toroid undiscovered, turn in my Narmer parts for Vox standing, and then depart with intent upon returning to Cetus.\n\nBoth the Rahn Prism and the Phahd Scaffold demand resources from the Plains, some of which I possess... The Pyrotic Alloy simply demands that I craft it briefly before setting out; I possess almost all of the necessary gemstones, leaving a trio of ingredients... A Beetle Shell, that apparently resides within a night-dwelling fish, some additional Iradite (Easy enough to simply gather on the go), and a single polished piece of Nyth. Nighttime would still be a while away, so in the meantime, I set out to hunt gems and plant-life... The Iradite eludes me for the time being, but luck would grant me that single piece of Nyth quite swiftly... Upon the collection of which, I return to the gates of Cetus, to acquire the blueprint for polishing this raw gemstone. It is upon greeting Suumbaat, and speaking of this gem, that I am greeted with the trick of my luck... It requires a trio of Nyth to refine it at all, not just the single piece that the Scaffold demands. At this point, it is nearing the nightfall hour, so I make preparations to harvest the necessary Beetle Shell. By account of the item itself, I will need to look to the oceans; unknown to me at the time, this specific fish would not make an appearance, unless entranced by the proper bait... After wasting most of the night cycle upon this matter, I finish gathering the rest of the necessary Nyth before returning to Cetus, where I question the presence of the fish, and learn of the needed bait. This bait... Requires a full two ranks earned, before I can purchase it at all.\n\nHaving gathered all but some loose materials, and becoming stalled by the daily standing caps, I return to the Orbiter, to inquire upon these vague Eidolon Shards (For while I was upon the Plains, I faced some floating sentient creatures, which provided no such shards)... It is then that I learn of the necessity to hunt the colossal night-walkers of the Plains, for these shards. It will be some time before night returns however, so instead I return, once more, to the freezing domain of the Temple Of Profit. The final Toroid eludes me just long enough for me to return, craft the final gemstones, and even begin harvesting loose Iradite, just before night returns to the Plains. At this point, I have half the Iradite, I'm missing 4 Beetle Shells, and a Repeller System. The latter duo will require several days of gaining standing, but for any of it to matter, I will need a collection of Eidolon Shards, for without such, the Quills won't even provide me with the blueprints. Thus, begins the Eidolon Culling.\n\nUpon starting this unique bounty, I quickly become aware that while I've seen these creatures, attempted to face them before, I had never successfully undertaken this endeavor prior. The unique process of acquiring lures, chaining the Eidolon down, and then summoning its brethren to repeat, proves to be a difficult task... But seemingly rewarding enough, for though I was still getting the basics down, a duo of this bounty yielded enough for the sake of ranking up with the Quills (Once, of course, the daily standing reset). All of this accomplished, a few ingredients still elude me, but there is little to be done for this day, so I depart for the time being.\n\n  \nA new dawn rises, and with it, a new daily standing cap. Onkko is my first stop, for his blueprints are the most important. It is easy enough to gather the rest of the standing, and use the Shards I've acquired for the sake of ranking up... Which reveals that, still being a rank away from the necessary blueprints, I will need another 20 of these Shards. A troubling notion, but not of the moment, for it will take a few days to fill the standing anyways. Instead, this quest takes me next to Fortuna, where I pay off further debts, and undertake a couple bounties to ensure that no daily standing is left unachieved. There are no resources left to acquire there but for the Repeller System, and thus I head to Cetus to undertake similar bounties (In both cases, it is Narmer missions, for the sake of the devices that may serve as standing with Vox Solaris), to gather the last Iradite and rank up... Upon these daylight bounties however, I encounter a Grineer Thumper of earnest prowess, and table the bounty for a spar against it's might. Upon its defeat, the machine spits forth a trio of the Beetle Shells that I need... Revealing the lack of necessity in gathering more standing for Cetus, for these machines can provide the second-to-last ingredient that I require.\n\nBefore I can harvest the final Shell, however, night falls over the Plains once more, and the Eidolon Hunt begins yet again. This time, having grasped the mechanics of the hunt, it takes only a single nightfall cycle in order to acquire the rest of the Shards that I might have purpose for (In addition to a Brilliant Shard which allowed for the final upgrade of my School of Focus), leaving me needing only the capacity for further standing.  \nWhen dawn rolls back around, a couple bounties gradually yield another duo of Thumper battles, which eventually provides the final Shell... Leaving only the Prism/Scaffold blueprints, and the Repeller System for acquisition.\n\nA few more days of standing gathering have then brought us to what might simply be another crest on this journey. The next daily standing reset will allow for ranking up with the Quills and Solaris United, which will allow for the acquisition of the necessary blueprints, and the undertaking of the high-priority mission where Repeller Systems can be found. So long as the Solaris mission does not reveal a final trick to this gargantuan quest, the Amp should soon be constructed, and a return can then be made to the halls of the Zariman, for the acquisition of the Thrax Plasms that instigated this odyssey.\n\nTo those who read this far, thank you for listening to my rambles! I just wanted to share this journey, because this has been one of the most memorable Warframes to attempt to acquire yet (And yes, I realize that in that same span of time, I could have likely just acquired the Plasms and been done with it, but then I would have, yet again, put off the effort of ever building an Amp anyways), and Gyre has been a Warframe that I thought looked interesting for years, even before I was established enough to properly gather anyone stronger than the starter Warframes.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1p6haor/the_quest_for_gyre/","permalink":"/r/Warframe/comments/1p6haor/the_quest_for_gyre/","score":11,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764088853.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Synthesis Scanner with those upgrades:  \n**Vector-Thread Widget** \\- Reduces the time required to scan a target with the Synthesis Scanner. Is a must as kavat specters are last for only a 7 seconds  \n**Cross-Matrix Widget** \\- Chance for each scan with the Synthesis Scanner to count as two scans. Chance for x2 codes from kavat.  \n**Sol-Battery Widget** \\- Scans no longer consume charges. There is near 50 kavats on mission, so this one is a good choice also\n\n3. Gather 50 kills to complete your first urn  \n4. Resource booster/Resource Drop Chance booster/Resource Drop Chance blessing (relay) all three works at the same time and boost kavat codes amount\n\nAfter completing 1rst urn, you will be visiting tomb for the second time. Place urn, enter the room. Take another urn and enter stealth. Feral Kavats will spawn after dialog will end - stay in stealth.  \nKavat code farm:\n\n1. Find kavat that is alone in the room/far away from the others\n2. Scan it from stealth\n3. Swap to Ballistica and kill kavat with **FULLY CHARGED SHOT**. Also you need to be near the kavat (within **50m**) for spectre to spawn\n4. Scan created spectre\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eydddykp2f3g1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=6386d6a9157155692aa56e03519cc714b67f9326\n\nWhy is it better to find solo kavats - specters that you create from Ballistica are hostile towards other kavats and jump a lot, but when spawned specters do not see enemies - they are calmly walking. Sleeping kavats only helps for the first scan as spawned specter will also aggro on sleeping enemies.  \nAlso you can scan all Kavats that are in the tomb, but after killing kavat another kavat will be spawned and it will be scannable also, I was annoyed by that and started scanning  \n1 kavat -> killing it -> scanning its specter -> move to another kavat\n\n21 minutes on mission and 142 kavat genetic codes were farmed for me, also I've missed \\~5 kavats to scan\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1uomgnal3f3g1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dec6baaa0738c74e64db66bb0f5389e1fb64878","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/1p6er2l/kavat_genetic_code_farm_on_sands_of_inaros_quest/","permalink":"/r/Warframe/comments/1p6er2l/kavat_genetic_code_farm_on_sands_of_inaros_quest/","score":7,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764083114.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Tool/Guide","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/gg1OhIPcPz186laLPj9-3q1rn0ALm3T9Q1Phf5gXxHk.jpg"}

{"id":"1p6dkeo","name":"t3_1p6dkeo","subreddit":"Warframe","author":"nintendo-assassin64","title":"My gas themed frame concept!","selftext":"So, a little backstory, i love elemental themes, my name is lightning (guess which element is my favorite), my main is volt, and overall, im a sucker for that kinda thing in games and series. So playing warframe is a special experience for me, as i love building my frames around certian themes, elemental or not for that matter, for instance, my nidus rocks a bubonico, pox, and lesion, and uses alot of viral damage in my builds, and my volt uses the amprex, and focuses on chain lightning nuking. But looking through warframes wide roster, i noticed something alot of others have noticed; a lack of a GAS themed frame. Now i get it, gas isnt the best by itself, but look at frost, cold isnt exactly game changing and yet hes solid, not the best, but solid. So i figured id do my best to not only give gas damage it's own frame, but make that frame viable and fun. So this, tenno, is VAPOR.\n\n\"skittering about, the origin system's finest vermin tear and pick at the carcass of dying planets for resources long gone, and wage blood feuds amongst eachother for the richest of scraps. But you, you will be my exterminator. You will purge the vermin, and you will clense these stars with your silent judgement.\"\n\nthis, is vapor\n\nI don't have official art of him, but what i can give you is a rough idea of him visually. Vapor is a heavy, industrial looking frame,  with vents and pipes adorned and affixed to his body, mixed with large metal plating and blinking lights thrown in. He'll have heavy \"military boots\" and wide shoulders. His helmet will resemble a fumigation rebreather, like a mix of mag and lavos, and he will have two noticable vents on his palms, and feet, with large metal pipes on his arms, legs, and neck. His colors will mostly be muted greens with striking bronze and brass for the mettalics, mixed with black accents, and his energy color being a brighter forest green. He will constantly spew gas from his vents and pipes, and he will feature gas canisters attached to his lower back, and tubing on his arms. My idea with vapor, is to make a frame akin to other elemental frame, but with the same level of synergy and polish of a modern frame.\n\nStats [at level 30]\n\nHealth: 350\n\nShields: 400\n\nArmor: 567\n\nEnergy: 200\n\n \nPassive: chemical bonding\n\nWhen passing through a gas cloud made from any source, vapor will heal 50 hp at base, and for every second standing in a gas cloud, he will slowly build critical chance for all of his weapons at 3% per second, and will cap out at 100% crit chance, that will dwindle slowly at 1% every 3 seconds when outside of a gas cloud. Enemies inflicted with gas procs will take double the crit damage on the weapon being used against then. \n\nALL ABILITIES WILL BE GIVEN STATS AS IF THEY ARE AT LEVEL 30.\n\nAbility 1: asphyxiation\n\n[25 energy]\n\nRange: a small 7m \"beam\" at the cursor, with the end of the \"beam\" creating a 10m gas cloud for 7 seconds. \n\nDamage: 650 gas damage. For every additional enemy within the cloud, the damage is multiplied. Inflicts a full stack of gas procs, which also double dips on the damage as it's own instance of DOT. \n\nDuration: 15s\n\nApon casing, vapor will hold out one of his hands and release a stream of lingering gas at a target. A simple and cheap elemental 1 similar to fireball, freeze, or shock, and is his bread and butter for spreading gas clouds.\n\nAugment: chemical reaction. Holding asphyxiation gives gas damage to other players in affinity range, and allow them to proc gas SEPARATELY, as not to mess up elemental combos.\n\nAbility 2: smog\n\n[35 energy]\n\nSmog cloud duration: 20s\n\nClinging cloud duration: 10s\n\nSmog cloud Radius: 15m\n\nClinging cloud radius: 8m\n \nAccuracy Debuff: 75%\n\nDamage vulnerability: 25%\n\nVapor strikes the ground, releasing a caliginous smog across a wide area and blinding all enemies caught inside, as well as giving them damage vulnerability. The smog clings to vapor and allies that come into contact with the cloud, blinding enemies within melee range and decreasing enemy accuracy from afar, with both effects lingering until the duration is up. This is vapor's main survivability tool, and gives him some small support as well. While the gas is lingering, his passive will still build up.\n\nAbility 3: vaccum \n\n[0 energy]\n\nRadius: 30m\n\nAdded damage: 50%\n\nVapor turns his vents in reverse, and sucks in all gas clouds made by his abilities within a large area, absorbing all the damage the clouds would've delt into one tick. Everytime vapor vacuums in 10 stacks worth of gas procs, it will fill one of the 6 canister icons next to his abilities.
