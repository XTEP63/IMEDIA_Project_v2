{"id":"1p6ry0i","name":"t3_1p6ry0i","subreddit":"Eldenring","author":"Jstar338","title":"I think Cleanrot Spear could have gotten some more love. Here's my idea","selftext":"Why make the weapon itself better, when we could just slap two together! I present the Cleanrot's Sanctity. A paired weapon, consisting of the Cleanrot Knight's Sword and Spear. Much like the knights you get them from, the thrusting sword would be wielded in the right hand, with the spear in the left. R1s would be standard thrusting sword, as would the R2. The charged heavy would be a lunging spear thrust followed by a stab from the sword. L1 would not have a special attack, but instead block. Guard counters from this block would use the spear. Obviously, the blocking stats from the original spear need some work, so here's my distribution.\n\nPhysical: 70\n\nMagic: 40\n\nFire: 30 (don't get hit by fire with this)\n\nLightning: 40\n\nHoly: 80\n\nBoost: 45\n\nMy thinking here is that the incantations on the shield defend greatly against Holy, decently against magic and lightning, and worse on Fire. It's below most small shields in terms of defenses, which is fine since it's a tiny shield. Also, throw away the 50 immunity that is worthless.\n\nDamage from both weapons are similar to the original, with slightly higher dex and faith scaling. The sword would be pure physical, while the spear retains holy damage.\n\nThe skill, another disappointing part of the original weapon, is changed. Rather than the stanced Sacred Phalanx, I'm instead going to take inspiration from the Cleanrot Knights.\n\nUnalloyed Stance: Cross the two weapons and thrust forward the small shield, releasing the blessing of the Unalloyed Gold embedded in the shield. Can be followed up with an additional input or normal attack.\n\nOn use, the guard boost and defenses of the shield are boosted heavily, similar to barricade shield. Additionally, a minor attack and defense buff are applied to yourself and allies. Heavy attacks will perform the same, with a guard counter being possible. R1 triggers a two hit slash with the sword, while L2 triggers the standard Sacred Phalanx. HOWEVER. If an attack is blocked by the initial action, the Sacred Phalanx hits harder and farther, with some decent stance damage.\n\nInitial input is 15 FP, with the slashes being free, while the Phalanx is 10. The buffs would be really small, to justify them. More than anything, it's for flavor since we see Cleanrot Knights buff themselves.\n\nEdit: I just realized that we have a normal damage weapon on the right that can't be infused. You can buff the sword, just for fun. Put whatever you want on it. Put unseen weapon on it just for shits and giggles","url":"https://i.redd.it/6m6r9uflgh3g1.png","permalink":"/r/Eldenring/comments/1p6ry0i/i_think_cleanrot_spear_could_have_gotten_some/","score":50,"num_comments":5,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764113034.0,"edited":1764113986.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion & Info","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/13fwfI0zl3mh7ugBQHkmjRRe2jhn5qs_5eZE5iU8IX8.jpg"}

This is one of the best games I have ever played, if not the best. \n\n130 hour playthrough. All 7 great runes gained and all 15 rememberance bosses killed. Very few guides or videos (mostly to get missing Sacred Tears), no summons, and very little magic. Melania took me about 15-20 hours.\n\nI started off as a spellsword/shield user up until Rennala at which point I was kind of tired of Glintstone Pebble and switched over to Blood Hound’s fang. I used that up until Rykard and then used the Blasphemous Blade for a couple of bosses but it felt too easy and so I decided to switch over to a heavy claymore with quickstep. This ended up being an amazing decision and made the game very fun. I used this claymore build from Morgott through the story ending (Ranni Ending). At this point I knew there were 15 rememberance bosses and I only had 14 of them so I went to the Haligtree area and against Melania I really struggled. Changed builds a few times and ended back on Blasphemous Blade since I could hit her with it during her Bloom recovery. \n\nI haven’t started the DLC yet as I want to cool down a bit. A buddy wants to ply Nightreign so I may do that before the DLC.\n\nThank you Fromsoft! \n\nEDIT: A few follow-up things I forgot. My favorite armor set is the twin armor. It’s just so well done and cool looking. I also didn’t like using Torrent in fights so I walked for Rahdan, Fire Giant, and Elden Beast. \n\nHardest boss in the game by far was Melania. Hell, her phase 1 is harder than any other boss. Followed by Radagon and GodSkin duo. \n\nI think I missed most quests in the game lol.\n\nHappy to chat about any part of the game Or answer questions!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1p6sadr/what_an_amazing_game/","permalink":"/r/Eldenring/comments/1p6sadr/what_an_amazing_game/","score":3,"num_comments":0,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764113929.0,"edited":1764115886.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion & Info","is_self":true,"spoiler":true,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"spoiler"}

I know the Erdtree expansion isn’t included on the disc, but I had hoped that since this edition has two discs (a key disc and a data disc) that it would contain the entire game on it, and at first it seemed like it would.\n\nBut after installing 48 GB off the data disc, and being prompted to insert the key disc for another 9 GB, it then prompted me to reinsert the data disc, which seemed odd to me. Then it popped up saying that Elden Ring required a 21 GB update, and if I try to ignore it the game doesn’t start up. So is this physical copy not playable off the disc, despite them going through the effort to add two discs in the box?

I’m level 54 and have most of my points in Vigor Endurance, Strength, and Dexterity. So far pretty much every ash of war on every weapon makes it considerably worse. At what point do ashes of war start benefiting you? \n\nMy next question is how the hell do I get some viable ranged options in this game? I have a wand and sacred seal and just enough intelligence and faith to cast some spells but they don’t really do much damage. Are spells only viable if you’re using that type of build? I also have the Longbow but again, arrows are kinda expensive and do hardly any damage. \n\nMy last question is regarding using different weapons. I found the Lordsworns Straight Sword early on and have upgraded it to +5. I’d love to use some different weapons but every new one I find is either too high level for me to use yet, or just does way less damage. I don’t want to waste all my smithing stones upgrading a bunch of different weapons but I’m also tired of always using the same weapon. \n\n\n\n ","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1p6k8wp/new_player_questions/","permalink":"/r/Eldenring/comments/1p6k8wp/new_player_questions/","score":1,"num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764095293.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion & Info","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
