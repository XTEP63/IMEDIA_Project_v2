No loading full articles, images, or HTML.  \nWhen it searches, it just gets a little preview: title, URL, short snippet, and an internal ID.

{"id":"1p6s9dk","name":"t3_1p6s9dk","subreddit":"ChatGPT","author":"Super-Independent-14","title":"Best LLM for ‘Sandboxing’?","selftext":"Disclaimer: I’ve never used an LLM on a live test and I condone such actions. However, having a robust and independent sandbox LLM to train and essentially tutor, I’ve found, is the #1 way I learn material.\n\nMy ultimate use case and what I am looking for is simple:\n\nI don‘t care about coding, pictures, creative writing, personality, or the model taking 20+ minutes on a task.\n\nI care about cutting it off from all web search and as much of its general knowledge as possible. I essentially want a logic machine writer/synthesizer with robust “dictionary” and “argumentative“ traits. Argumentative in the scholarly sense — drawing stedfast conclusions from premises that it cites ad nauseam from a knowledge base that only I give it.\n\nThink of uploading 1/10 of all constitutional law and select Supreme Court cases, giving it a fact pattern and essay prompt, and having it answer by only the material I give it. In this instance, citing an applicable case outside of what I upload to it will be considered a hallucination — not good.\n\nSo any suggestions on which LLM is essentially the best use case for making a ‘sandboxed’ lawyer that will diligently READ, not ‘scan’, the fact pattern, do multiple passes over it’s ideas for answers, and essentially question itself in a robust fashion — AKA extremely not cocky?\n\nI had a pretty good system through ChatGPT when there was a o3 pro model available, but a lot has changed since then and it seems less reliable on multiple fronts. I used to be able to enable o3 pro deep research AND turn the web research off, essentially telling it to deep research the vast documents I’d upload to it instead, but that’s gone now too as far as I can tell. No more o3 pro, and no more enabling deep research while also disabling its web search and general knowledge capabilities.\n\nThay iteration of gpt was literally a god in law school essays. I used it to study by training it through prompts, basically teaching myself by teaching IT. I was eventually able to feed it old practice exams cold and it would spot every issue, answer in near perfect IRAC for each one, plays devil‘s advocate for tricky uncertainties. By all metrics it was an A law school student across multiple classes when compared to the model answer sheet. Once I honed its internal rule set, which was not easy at all, you could plug and play any material into it, prompt/upload the practice law school essay and the relevant ‘sandboxed knowledge bank’, and he would ace everything.\n\nI basically trained an infant on complex law ideas, strengthening my understanding along the way, to end up with an uno reverse where he ended up tutoring me.\n\nBut it required me doing a lot of experimenting with prompts, ‘learning‘ how it thought and constructing rules to avoid hallucinations and increase insightfulness, just to name a few. The main breakthrough was making it cite from the sandboxed documents, through bubble hyper link cites to the knowledge base I uploaded to it, after each sentence it wrote. This dropped his use of outside knowledge and “guesses” to negligible amounts.\n\nI can’t stress enough: for law school exams, it’s not about answering correctly, as any essay prompt and fact pattern could be answered with simple web search to a good degree with any half way decent LLM. The problem lies in that each class only touches on \\~10% of the relevant law per subject, and if you go outside of that \\~10% covered in class, you receive 0 points. That‘s why the ’sandboxability’ is paramount in a use case like this.\n\nBut since that was a year ago, and gpt has changed so much, I just wanted to know what the best ‘sandbox’ capable LLM/configuration is currently available. ‘Sandbox’ meaning essentially everything I’ve written above.\n\nTL:DR: What’s the most intelligent LLM that I can make stupid, then make him smart again by only the criteria I deem to be real to him?\n\nAny suggestions?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1p6s9dk/best_llm_for_sandboxing/","permalink":"/r/ChatGPT/comments/1p6s9dk/best_llm_for_sandboxing/","score":1,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764113859.0,"edited":false,"link_flair_text":"Educational Purpose Only ","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Am I missing something?","selftext":"I recently started using ChatGPT for professional research and creative writing projects, to do data analysis, find trends, etc. It worked so well, I decided to upgrade to a Business account so I could have integration with Gmail, Google Drive and stronger analytic capacity. \n\nA series of things went wrong with my account -- from what I understand, a combination of signing up with Apple and a provisioning error on the backend -- that rendered it useless. \n\nI have tried myriad ways of contacting ChatGPT and there seems to be no way to get effective help. I used the chat function on the OpenAI page and asked to speak to a human -- they said I would be contacted by email. They contacted me DAYS later and the human agent sent me scripted responses were not in anyway relevant to my stated problem, and when I responded, or he asked the same questions that were clearly answered already. Or I received an AI response saying my situation had been escalated and it would be fixed shortly. Then I would get an email from the same human several days later saying they were closing the ticket because they hadn't heard back from me. I went through four increasingly bizarre/unprofessional/Kafka-eque rounds of trying to get help via that email address before I went back to the Customer Service bot and they told me to contact the billing address because it was staffed by humans and they could just cancel the subscription rather than try to fix the technical problem. When I did that, I got a bounced email response. I took this back to the Customer Service Bot, they said, \"Oh right, this email was actually closed by ChatGPT last year\" and referred me back to the same customer service chat function that I was speaking to them through. You couldn't actually script a more byzantine system.\n\nThe problems with my account mean that I cannot cancel my account itself, so I'm just stuck paying for something I cannot use. I will take care of the latter through a vendor dispute with Amex, but I feel like I'm missing something really basic as a non-techie new user:\n\nIs the company really this bad? Are they totally unaccountable to their users on both functionality and billing? It seems like such unprofessional behavior. I would understand bad customer service, but this seems like fraud-level bad. Or am I just having a really exceptional experience?  \n\n\nI'm mostly just curious, because I'm new to ChatGPT after hearing how amazing it was, and it seems totally absurd, bordering on corrupt (never mind the fact that I can't use it for it's purpose).\n\n  \nThank you!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1p6n0so/im_new_to_chatgpt_and_am_stuck_in_customer/","permalink":"/r/ChatGPT/comments/1p6n0so/im_new_to_chatgpt_and_am_stuck_in_customer/","score":1,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764101398.0,"edited":false,"link_flair_text":"Other ","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
