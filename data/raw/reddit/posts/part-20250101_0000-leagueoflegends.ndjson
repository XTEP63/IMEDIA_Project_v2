You'd think I'd be the perfect person to help with queue times, right? Wrong.\n\nIf I queue mid/support I get support most of the time.\n\nSo what does Riot's system force me to do? I queue mid/top now. I don't even really enjoy top lane, but at least I actually get to play my main role sometimes.\n\nHere's the thing no one seems to understand: **by making support such a \"guaranteed\" role, they're actively discouraging people from putting it as secondary.** Everyone knows if you put support secondary, that's just your primary now with extra steps.\n\nI *WANT* to queue support as my secondary. I'd happily play support 30-40% of my games. But I'm not willing to play it 95% of my games. So instead of getting a willing support player in the queue, Riot gets... nothing. I queue top secondary instead, which just adds to top lane congestion.\n\nMultiply this by thousands of players who feel the same way and you've got a self-fulfilling prophecy. Support stays unpopular because nobody wants to put it secondary, because putting it secondary means you're a support main now.\n\nIf they just balanced it so mid/support actually gave you the same mid priority as mid/top, I guarantee you'd see way more people willing to put support as their secondary. But instead we get this system that punishes you for being flexible.\n\nAnyone else feel this way or am I just coping?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p67tw4/the_support_secondary_queue_problem_is_making_the/","permalink":"/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p67tw4/the_support_secondary_queue_problem_is_making_the/","score":1977,"num_comments":398,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764061675.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

There isn’t one main team who seems like they’ll steam roll the entire league. \n\nTL and Lyon look really good and are the contenders to make it to internationals this year. I’m happy to see Josedeodo back in the league and I can’t wait to see how Zamudo performs in NA. \n\nFly is one of the teams I’ll be really looking at this year. Their strategy of using younger talent is great and I can’t wait to see how they play. \n\nC9 and Shopify barely changed but they both look good. If APA can gel with the C9 players and Zinie is the prodigy that he’s been hyped up to be, both teams can be in high contention\n\nSentinels, DSG, and DIG haven’t completed their rosters but DSG and Sentinels looks promising. Sentinels just robbed DSG of their roster last year but I think they’ll do good. DARKWINGS in particular I want to see how he fairs. DSG also is brining in a lot of new talent into the league so that looks promising. DIG is DIG so I don’t have a lot of hope for them but if they can bring in some exciting players that’d be nice.\n\nThe most exciting thing about this year is how many new players from T2 are being brought in. 4/8 teams have players who have barely any tier 1 experience or none at all. It’s really exciting to see and I can’t wait to see how they perform.\n\nI personally don’t care how we’ll fare at internationals (as long as we beat EU lol) but seeing how many decent rosters we have has me excited to see how domestically competitive the league will be and I can’t wait to see these teams in action.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6k4hw/this_lcs_offseason_has_made_me_so_excited_to/","permalink":"/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6k4hw/this_lcs_offseason_has_made_me_so_excited_to/","score":103,"num_comments":52,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764095026.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Esports","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I’m curious how other longtime players feel about it.\n\n\n\nFor me, the game felt very different back when I was watching early LCS/Worlds and following players like Toys, Faker, and later WildTurtle when he joined TSM. I remember watching his solo queue runs and feeling inspired to improve. Over time, I put in a lot of hours and had plenty of fun moments, but also noticed that the general flow of games and the matchmaking environment felt different compared to the early years.\n\n\n\nAfter playing for so long, I think I’ve finally hit the point where I’m not connecting with the game the same way I used to. I’m genuinely interested in whether other players who have been around for a decade or so have had similar shifts in how they experience the game.\n\n\n\nSo my question is:\n\nFor those who have been playing League for many seasons, how has the game changed for you personally?

Now this isn't the first time Riot has left out important characters relating to the story/lore (yorick in ruination) but I just can't happen to notice that Riot has created 2 ionian cinematics and Shen has made zero appearances in. And even worst is that it would make a whole lot of sense to have shen in them, but they decide not to add him anyways.\n\nThe two cinematics I am referring to are \"Awaken\" and most recently \"Twilights End\". \n\nIn the Awaken cinematic irelia needs saving from sion from the invasion, instead of shen showing up to save/protect irelia they instead have karma save her and everyone else who is correlated to shen (except shen) shows up to defend/fight back on the invasion. Shens character who's meant to protect people isn't shown at all, unless for a lore reason why not?\n\nThen we get to the Twilight Ends cinematic, which makes absolutely no sense why shen didn't show up. Not only are xin and yunara fighting a powerful demon which shens purpose in lore is to kill powerful demons, but also once again the protagonist needs saving and shen is no where to be found. The excuse why he didn't show up? Because he was \"far away\".\n\nWhat? The character who can teleport is too far away to fight a powerful demon that he somehow didn't know about? It's really just sad how much Riot tries so hard to keep characters that THEY created to not be in the lore.

But then you look at champions, and Riot basically lets them do whatever they want—playing champs in roles they weren’t even designed for because of how flexible the item builds are. It’s kind of funny how they complain about item complexity but embrace all this role-swapping and weird builds with champions.\n\nItems get all this heat for being “too confusing” and Riot tries to tone them down for newbies. Meanwhile, champions can be mid laners one game, supports the next, or even bruisers when you least expect it. And so much of that flexibility comes from items themselves, which Riot says are too complex. So, which is it?\n\nAt the end of the day, Riot treats items like they’re the problem and tries to limit what they do, but they’re totally fine with letting champions be super flexible and complicated because of those very same items. It’s a bit hypocritical—they want the game to be easier for new players, but they keep the complexity alive by allowing champs to be everything and anything depending on how you build them.\n\nSo if items really are too complex for newcomers, why does Riot let champs flex so hard with those same items? It’s like they want simplicity but also want to keep the depth for experienced players—and that double standard creates a confusing mess for everyone. Riot’s afraid of item complexity but then turns around and embraces it fully in champion flexibility. Makes you wonder what new players are really supposed to focus on learning first.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6dko5/items_vs_champions/","permalink":"/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6dko5/items_vs_champions/","score":1,"num_comments":4,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764080277.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

It’s something people don’t talk about enough. Personally, I think the assassin class is actually the most difficult class in the game to play. I know a lot of people will disagree, but that’s just my opinion. And because assassins rely so much on decision-making, confidence, timing, and not hesitating, I genuinely believe that fixing your mental alone can make someone climb an entire rank, even a rank and a half or two depending on how bad their mental was before. The importance of mental in League is really overshadowed, especially for assassins.\n\nFor Talon specifically, something I’ve always wondered is how people navigate games where there’s only *one* person you can reliably kill. Like, imagine the jungler is a bruiser, the top laner is a bruiser, the support is a tank, and even the mid laner is someone who’s naturally hard for Talon to kill. If the only real target you have is the ADC, how do you play those games without feeling like your entire kill threat is minimized? And on top of that, when you *are* ahead or even if you’re the only fed person on your team, what exactly is your mid-game to late-game plan as Talon supposed to look like? What are you aiming for to actually close out games?\n\nI’d appreciate structured and genuinely helpful advice on this, not meme answers, just proper, objective guidance on how Talon mains approach these situations.\n\nAssassins rely heavily on mental, and I genuinely believe fixing your mindset alone can raise you 1–2 ranks. For Talon, I want advice on two things:\n\n1. How do you play games where the only reliable kill target is the ADC?\n2.

{"id":"1p6n3e9","name":"t3_1p6n3e9","subreddit":"leagueoflegends","author":"Stunning-Radish-481","title":"A League player tries out and compares League and Dota.","selftext":"I'm sure there have been a ton of posts like this, but as they say, I'm not the first, I'm not the last.\n\n\n\nSo, I'm a League player, and it's worth noting that I'm pretty bad at it. I have Silver 3 and have been playing jungle for four years. And I wanted to play a different, but popular, MOBA. Besides Dota, there are essentially no other live games in this genre. I'd like to point out that I'll be comparing these two games specifically in terms of quality and enjoyment, not which is more difficult.\n\n\n\nSo, let's start with the technical part. To play these two wonderful games, you first need to launch them, but both have issues with that. You launch the coolest Rito client, click on League of Legends, and see a notification that you need to restart your computer to start the game. You restart your computer, click Play, the League logo appears, wait 3 minutes, nothing happens, open Task Manager, which has 30 League of Legends files, close them all, launch the game again, and it starts, but you see a message that errors need to be fixed and you need to wait 7 minutes. You wait 10 minutes instead of 7, click Play, select Ranked matches, and you can't click the search button. You restart the game again, and miraculously, you've successfully launched the search for a game in League of Legends. And this happens every 3-4 times.\n\nIn Dota, things aren't much better, but still better. You search for and accept a game, but you get a gray screen, and a minute later, you find out you're going to suffer in LVP because \"The remote server is not responding to requests.\" This problem can be solved by creating a lobby on any server several times. By the way, a video guide on how to solve this problem has been on YouTube for over a year.\n\nWell, from a technical standpoint, everything is clear: I have an average computer that has become rather weak over the years (a 1050 Ti, some kind of i3 Intel, and 8GB of RAM). League runs smoothly on high settings with a bunch of applications running. Dota only runs smoothly on minimum settings, even with Discord closed.\n\nCommunity: And here I'd like to say that the League community is much more toxic than Dota, but the Dota community is super selfish and full of whiners, in my opinion. What I mean is that in Dota, insults in chat are commonplace, and the most you get is something about your mother, but in League... in League, besides recommendations to kill yourself, in every game you might be told that they'll come to war in your country to kill you and your family because you didn't gank the mid laner. But in Dota, the problem is different: you literally play 1v9 almost every game because people are ready to steal every creep, every jungler, every kill, and all this despite the fact that you're on their team. Of course, this happens in League, too, but in Dota, it's taken to the extreme. Secondly, whiners, you've played your 1-2 positions in all roles, earned your well-deserved tokens, and just want to play position 3? Your 4 or 5 don't agree, and if you don't give them the lane, they'll, at best, go AFK. On average, they'll just take a second offlaner and farm creeps with you. At worst, they'll start openly feeding you. And that's a real problem: if you press the search button on core roles, you'll get anything but the gameplay intended by the game. You'll be left alone, or your opponent will be left alone. A whiner will join you in your lane, and you'll be three-man. A whiner will join your opponent, and they'll be three-man. And in League, this problem is virtually nonexistent. The last time someone refused to join my lane, it was two years ago in LoL (and by the way, on the Russian server, not West). And here's the big difference: a Dota player will say they don't want to play support, and if you don't give them a core role, they'll go AFK. Meanwhile, a League player will simply accept the situation or dodge the game.\n\nSpeaking of dodge the game, I didn't think it was possible to create an honor system worse than League, but it turns out it can! So, as I understand it, how the honor system works. If you play a game and no one reports you, you get more honor, but if you get reported, you get less, no matter if it was a 0/2 axe who just thinks you stole all their kills. Punishments in Dota are much worse than in the LP league, and even getting banned from ranked. So, people spend YEARS trying to get back their 3k honor in turbo and can't because they get reported.\n\nI'd also like to mention the matchmaking time, even though I'm from the CIS, but in the league I mostly play on the Western server, not the Russian one, and there, matches for any role are found in less than 5 minutes. In Dota, at any time of day, finding a match for the first position takes more than 5-7 minutes, and finding a game in the morning is almost impossible because the game's target audience has gone to school.\n\nFinally, I'd like to say that I most likely made a mistake somewhere, as I've only played about 200 hours and am a Recruit rank 4, and I just wanted to share my experience. Thank you.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6n3e9/a_league_player_tries_out_and_compares_league_and/","permalink":"/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6n3e9/a_league_player_tries_out_and_compares_league_and/","score":0,"num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764101558.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Saw the replies to be welcoming hence i decided to finally give it a try.\n\nDownloaded the game from the riot client, and then the game opened, and i probably experienced the worst ui experiences I've had in recent times.\n\nImmediately i was stuck in a small window with the tutorial screen and a \"patching\" option at the bottom. I restarted the game a few times because it felt bugged as i already downloaded the game from the client and tried searching the internet to realise apparently the game was downloading, without a loading bar or any indication of download unless you check your task manager. It took 7 hours in total for it to fix itself, i left it dormant for the first 4, restarted it again and left it again and got the play now logo after an excruciating 3 hours. My internet isn't the fastest (200mbps) but i cannot fathom how that's not enough for such an old title.\n\nI decided to then launch the the first tutorial out of the three, the first one deals with movement and champions, it took a while to get used to the weird right click movement control but i figured it eventually and clicked with miss fortune. In the next screen i was given a choice to select a free champion and I picked miss fortune and thought I'll proceed to the next tutorial.\n\nIdk what in god's name happened but the game has decided to stuck itself on the first tutorial, and keeps the second one (purchasing items) with a locked icon. I have restarted the game alot of times now, played the first tutorial 4 times to see if it unlocks the second one, but it's just not registering that I've played the first one.\n\nI've lost all my enthusiasm to play this game just by this horrendous experience, and i want to know if there's any fix for this tutorial bug and also want to know why are such glaring issues prevalent in such an established title.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6jdnm/had_the_worst_experience_as_a_new_player/","permalink":"/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6jdnm/had_the_worst_experience_as_a_new_player/","score":0,"num_comments":29,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764093431.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

For example toplane enjoyment would skyrocket if everyone was playing Ambessa Jayce and counterpicking with champions like Malphite.\n\nBut since its universally agreed upon that onetricking is bad.

As if whispered by the gaming gods themselves.  \n**Maybe we should let people play what they enjoy and have fun.**\n\nForcing people out of their comfort zones should only be done to get them to try new things they might enjoy.

He starts with much more mana than Blitzcrank, and since his hook costs less, Pyke can cast up to **6 hooks at level 1** before running out of mana, while Blitzcrank can cast **2** (3 accounting for the mana regen in between cooldowns). So literally double the amount of hooks at level 1, and that's in the case that he **misses all of them** and doesn't get their cost refunded.  \nPyke's Q cooldown starts at 10 seconds, while Blitz's starts at 20 seconds. So **Pyke can cast twice more hooks, at half the time**.\n\nPyke's passive allows him to regenerate up to **55% of his maximum HP** (extreme case scenario, on full lethality build) on **no cooldown**, while Blitzcrank gets a goofy ahh shield that's based on his mana on a **90 second cooldown**.\n\nWithout getting into much details into his other basic abilities, Pyke also gets movement speed ability buff with invisibility on a ridiculous low cooldown (get out of jail card #1) and an AOE-stun dash that combines with flash to double its effective range (get out of jail card #2). Blitzcrank on the other hand gets a movement speed buff (which although starts higher than Pyke's,  of course becomes lower when Pyke has **20 lethality (2 Dirks)**) that increases his attack speed (?) and self slows him (lol).\n\nAnd last but not least, Pyke's Ultimate. **AOE ranged execute that refreshes** even if Pyke actually messes up its timing (refresh is granted even if the enemy champion inside its radius dies **before** Pyke actually touches them). \n\nBlitzcrank's Ultimate silences for 0.5 seconds, and removes shields. Its use case is either to stop one enemy champion from finishing a cast, or removing a huge shield from a champion like Sett. Most extreme scenario of getting value out of this ability is using it after Karma's R-E shield combo (which funnily has a lower cooldown than Blitz's R up until level 16 lol)\n\nBonus Fact: Pyke has 123 base armor at level 18, meaning he actually receives less than 50% of all the physical damage he is dealt to... As an assassin champion... with a hook... and an AOE stun... and an AOE execute that refreshes...\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6ky6r/blitzcrank_and_pyke_being_in_the_same_game_is_a/","permalink":"/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1p6ky6r/blitzcrank_and_pyke_being_in_the_same_game_is_a/","score":0,"num_comments":15,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764096836.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
