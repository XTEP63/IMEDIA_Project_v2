After doing some more digging I found proof of the same company doing this kind of work for a bunch of other games including\n\n* Split Fiction\n\n* World of Warships\n\n* War Thunder\n\n* Mandragora\n\n* Misery\n\n* Active Matter\n\n* Gloomy Eyes\n\n* Bee Simulator\n\n* Tabletop Game Shop Simulator\n\nThe company has an [entire page](https://archive.is/wOKYI) advertising this work with examples (link is archived) and one of the people there has made posts on Linkedin [showing](https://i.imgur.com/oHPFf3Q.jpeg) [off](https://i.imgur.com/Z07Ybxd.jpeg) [some](https://i.imgur.com/cphhgGe.png) [work](https://i.imgur.com/DMW2VMG.png) they did to astroturf reddit. None of the reddit accounts they use are marked as sponsored or give any hint they have anything to do with the games they're advertising.\n\nAgain this probably isn't the only company doing this, but it is a good look at how they operate. These kind of accounts are pretty hard to catch (unless they literally just post about doing it like in these examples) and they know that, writing that\n\n> We build them up with genuine posts, we test formats, we diversify activity. The goal is simple: when a campaign goes live, the account already looks and feels natural to Redditors.\n\nI don't think there's a good way to stop this unless the admins actually do something, but just wanted to make this follow-up post to shine a light on some of the games abusing reddit.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1otoist/how_split_fiction_world_of_warships_and_other/","permalink":"/r/Games/comments/1otoist/how_split_fiction_world_of_warships_and_other/","score":3069,"num_comments":825,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762805455.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

This is one of the best games I've played all year. There is a great deal of depth and customization that really showcases player choice and creativity, with an unbeatable replayability.\n\n-------------\n\n**[CGMagazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/82/cgmagazine)** - [Dayna Eileen](https://opencritic.com/critic/8194/dayna-eileen) - [9 / 10](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/anno-117-pax-romana-pc/)\n\n>Though not exactly gentle on new players, Anno 117: Pax Romana is not only one of the most stunning city-builders I have ever played, but it is also extremely rewarding.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cerealkillerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/465/cerealkillerz)** - [Steve Brieller](https://opencritic.com/critic/9606/steve-brieller) - *German* - [8.7 / 10](https://cerealkillerz.org/review-anno-117-pax-romana/)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana improves on the older titles and while the campaign wasn't that captivating in the end, the sandbox mode works like a charm and glued us to our pc for hours.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitally Downloaded](https://opencritic.com/outlet/65/digitally-downloaded)** - [Matt Sainsbury](https://opencritic.com/critic/1604/matt-sainsbury) - [4.5 / 5 ](https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/11/review-anno-117-pax-romana-sony-playstation-5.html)\n\n>The very best city builders make you want to learn about urban planning, and with Anno 117 it comes with a second benefit – it’ll make you want to learn more about what made the Ancient Roman cities tick as well.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Samuel Buchmann](https://opencritic.com/critic/11536/samuel-buchmann) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40324)\n\n>\"Anno 117: Pax Romana\" is everything I hoped it would be. The campaign is short but entertaining, and the gameplay is easy to learn but difficult to master. Every detail feels well thought out and perfectly balanced. Thanks to countless quality-of-life features, I can concentrate on the exciting things: the layout of my city, efficient supply, and the expansion of my empire. The new mechanics force me to make interesting decisions. \n>I only have two minor criticisms. First, Latium and Albion are pretty and lively, but a little too colorful and exaggerated for my taste. Second, I don't particularly enjoy the combat system with its sluggish controls. However, neither of these points detracts much from my overall impression – for me, “Pax Romana” is the best “Anno” game ever.\n\n-------------\n\n**[DualShockers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/285/dualshockers)** - [Jaime Tugayev](https://opencritic.com/critic/10859/jaime-tugayev) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/anno-117-pax-romana-review/)\n\n>There are some pacing issues with the campaign, and I have questions about the longevity of single-player modes, but that does not take away from the fact that this is an excellent city builder that tells a Roman tale with the grandeur it deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Everyeye.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/425/everyeye-it)** - [Alessandro Preziosi](https://opencritic.com/critic/9334/alessandro-preziosi) - *Italian* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/recensione-anno-117-pax-romana-senato-approva-pure-66370.html)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[Evilgamerz](https://opencritic.com/outlet/878/evilgamerz)** - [Daan Nijboer](https://opencritic.com/critic/10035/daan-nijboer) - *Dutch* - [8.5 / 10](https://evilgamerz.com/anno-117-pax-romana/)\n\n>With the return of land combat, warfare takes a somewhat larger role, but never takes over. For players who like to build their empires slowly and optimize every production chain, Pax Romana offers exactly what you expect, and more. The addition of mouse and keyboard, in particular, also allows console players to experience the Anno series as they do on PC. The visual presentation is impressive, the music atmospheric, and the systems well-balanced. At times, the game feels a bit safe, as if Ubisoft Mainz didn't want to take any major risks, but what it does offer is of high quality.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GAMES.CH](https://opencritic.com/outlet/762/games-ch)** - [Steffen Haubner](https://opencritic.com/critic/9589/steffen-haubner) - *German* - [92%](https://www.games.ch/anno-117-pax-romana/test/review-mA4/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------\n\n**[GRYOnline.pl](https://opencritic.com/outlet/559/gryonline-pl)** - [Konrad Sarzyński](https://opencritic.com/critic/10085/konrad-sarzy-ski) - *Polish* - [7.5 / 10](https://www.gry-online.pl/recenzje/recenzja-anno-117-pax-romana-ubisoft-odgrzewa-klasyke-zachowujac/z74883)\n\n>Anno 117 is, as a whole, a fine game that will allow fans of the series to enter a new era and enjoy mechanics that are more complex than those of its predecessor. The soundtrack is great, and the graphics are very pleasing to the eye. However, I feel that Ubisoft has played it a little too safe and lazy. Although I personally love Anno 1800, I didn't necessarily want the new instalment to be so similar to it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Game8](https://opencritic.com/outlet/963/game8)** - [Aaron Bacabac](https://opencritic.com/critic/11268/aaron-bacabac) - [86 / 100](https://game8.co/articles/reviews/anno-117-pax-romana-review)\n\n>Rome wasn’t built in a day, and neither was Pax Romana. Every hour of craftsmanship shows in its design, every detail polished to perfection, creating a monument to the genre, crowned with a golden eagle and a banner to match. Flaws remain, of course, with minor bugs serving as reminders that no edifice is perfect. Yet the game still stands tall, and unlike the empire, your own Rome can rise much faster. Some may even expect it in a day.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpew](https://opencritic.com/outlet/408/gamespew)** - [Chris McMullen](https://opencritic.com/critic/3888/chris-mcmullen) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespew.com/2025/11/anno-117-pax-romana-review/)\n\n>Whether you're a series veteran or a newcomer, Anno 117: Pax Romana is a delightfully deep time-sink of a game. This gripping historical(ish) city-builder will have you hooked thanks to its complex drama and engrossing gameplay.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameWatcher](https://opencritic.com/outlet/295/gamewatcher)** - [Bogdan Robert](https://opencritic.com/critic/5104/bogdan-robert) - [7.5 / 10](https://www.gamewatcher.com/reviews/Anno-117-Pax-Romana-review/13470)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana is a more measured, relaxed city builder than its predecessor, operating on a smaller scale while reshuffling key elements of the series' well-established formula to varying amounts of success. Both familiar and refreshing, it makes you think differently about how you build your cities.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Anita van Beugen](https://opencritic.com/critic/10558/anita-van-beugen) - *Dutch* - [5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/anno-117-pax-romana-review-de-perfecte-anno-game/6701-1-1-234)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana has utterly stolen my heart, refining the familiar Anno formula with deeper systems, richer choices, and a stunning Roman-Celtic setting that offers players more freedom, smarter progression, and just enough imperfections to remind you that even near-perfection can still feel human.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Joe Chivers](https://opencritic.com/critic/9930/joe-chivers) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/strategy/anno-117-pax-romana-review/)\n\n>I donned my proto-capitalist top hat and tails and got to work.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Leana Hafer](https://opencritic.com/critic/7792/leana-hafer) - [9 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/anno-117-pax-romana-review)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana is a gorgeous antique city-builder that sucked me in for dozens of hours as I planned out my next district or simply watched the bustle along my aqueduct-accented boulevards. I think this series and I were always destined to hit it off, but we kept missing each other or meeting up at the wrong times. I really get Anno now, and I could hardly be more enthused. The fantastic, deep trade system with a side of exciting naval combat really seals the deal. I could take or leave the campaign, but I still don't think I've run out of things to do in the highly customizable endless mode. It may not quite be fit for a triumph, but is certainly worthy of a standing ovation.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN Italy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/477/ign-italy)** - [Alessandro Alosi](https://opencritic.com/critic/6452/alessandro-alosi) - *Italian* - [8 / 10](https://it.ign.com/anno-117-pax-romana/221772/review/anno-117-pax-romana-la-recensione)\n\n>The Anno series looks to the past but aims to the future with a balanced, substantial chapter, with few flaws and a lot of heart divided between Latinum and Albion.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN Spain](https://opencritic.com/outlet/471/ign-spain)** - Mario Sánchez - *Spanish* - [8 / 10](https://es.ign.com/anno-117-pax-romana/223312/review/analisis-de-anno-117-pax-romana-un-juego-de-estrategia-y-gestion-que-enganchara-incluso-a-los-novato)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana combines an engaging narrative with an excellent learning curve and deep, addictive gameplay. Although the visual details could be improved, it keeps the player fully immersed in city-building.\n\n-------------\n\n**[INVEN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/805/inven)** - [Jaihoon Jeong](https://opencritic.com/critic/8141/jaihoon-jeong) - *Korean* - [8.1 / 10](https://www.inven.co.kr/webzine/news/?news=311152)\n\n>ANNO 117: PAX ROMANA is not a typical city builder; it is a simulator that requires balancing supply and demand within a detailed economic system while also considering diplomacy. The result is a deeply engaging experience, though the high level of concentration it demands can be somewhat exhausting.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MMORPG.com](https://opencritic.com/outlet/118/mmorpg-com)** - [9 / 10](https://www.mmorpg.com/reviews/review-anno-117-pax-romana-is-the-biggest-the-franchise-has-ever-been-2000136551)\n\n>The gameplay is easy to learn but challenging to master, and in terms of bringing new audiences to Anno, I think this can do it, without overwhelming them with the systems. Still, that depth and challenge are there for those seeking it, especially for those among us with hundreds of hours in one save.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Manual dos Games](https://opencritic.com/outlet/910/manual-dos-games)** - [Erik Vasconcellos](https://opencritic.com/critic/11333/erik-vasconcellos) - *Portuguese* - [8.3 / 10](https://manualdosgames.com/review-anno-117-pax-romana-pc)\n\n>With major improvements over its predecessor, Anno 117: Pax Romana makes use of ray tracing technology for global illumination and reflections, creating a beautiful and immersive atmosphere. The gameplay has been refined, with the addition of new mechanics that add greater depth to the experience. However, not everything is perfect as the time required to complete each research task is quite long, which can lead to some fatigue due to the duration and the large number of points to unlock. Still, the game offers great rewards to the player.\n\n-------------\n\n**[NoobFeed](https://opencritic.com/outlet/616/noobfeed)** - [Nusrat Choity](https://opencritic.com/critic/11382/nusrat-choity) - [80 / 100](https://noobfeed.com/reviews/anno-117-pax-romana-review)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana is a new take on the Anno formula that builds on what came before. It embodies the franchise's strategic DNA, but it also introduces complexity through moral decisions, character-driven stories, and a retrospective look at history.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - Charles Monrose - [7.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/anno-117-pax-roma-ps5-review/)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Roma delivers the same satisfying city-building loop as Anno 1800 but offers little innovation beyond a Roman skin. While still fun and deep for newcomers, veterans may find it more like a reskin. The PS5 version suffers from mediocre graphics, hard to navigate UI, and awkward controller support - but keyboard and mouse are supported. Good game, flawed console port.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Prima Games](https://opencritic.com/outlet/817/prima-games)** - [Enzo Zalamea](https://opencritic.com/critic/10546/enzo-zalamea) - [9 / 10](https://primagames.com/reviews/anno-117-pax-romana-review-revel-in-the-roman-times)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana successfully expands the franchise, blending the depth of Anno 1800’s refined mechanics with a stunning Roman backdrop. Set across the provinces of Latium and Albion, it challenges players with complex city-building systems, resource management, and strategic decision-making, in an addicting way. The addition of diagonal construction, land combat, and an intricate research and religion system adds new layers of creativity and control. Anno 117: Pax Romana is one of the best city-building management games money can buy right now.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SECTOR.sk](https://opencritic.com/outlet/615/sector-sk)** - tomass - *Slovak* - [8.5 / 10](https://www.sector.sk/recenzia/40301/anno-117-pax-romana.htm)\n\n>The latest installment of the popular strategy series has moved to the period of historical Rome. It brought various gameplay improvements and traditionally excellent management.\n\n-------------\n\n**[SavePoint Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/960/savepoint-gaming)** - [Jake Su](https://opencritic.com/critic/6215/jake-su) - [9 / 10](https://savepointgaming.co/review/anno-117-pax-romana-review-pc/)\n\n>A triumph of design and discipline, Anno 117: Pax Romana elevates the city-builder to an art form, where an empire of balance, built on trade, faith and foresight, rises above all.\n\n-------------\n\n**[The Nerd Stash](https://opencritic.com/outlet/884/the-nerd-stash)** - [Julio La Pine](https://opencritic.com/critic/10143/julio-la-pine) - [8.5 / 10](https://thenerdstash.com/anno-117-pax-romana-review-an-empire-wasnt-built-in-a-day/)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana is an excellent entry for newcomers, while also adding many features that will bring back the most die-hard fans of the series.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Uagna](https://opencritic.com/outlet/903/uagna)** - [Silvia Mannu](https://opencritic.com/critic/10673/silvia-mannu) - *Italian* - [9 / 10](https://www.uagna.it/videogiochi/anno-117-pax-romana-recensione-209480)\n\n>Anno 117: Pax Romana marks a new chapter in Ubisoft's management saga. It is clear that the experience gained during the development of Anno 1800 has served to create a product that is polished and profound in every aspect, but also easy to access. Of course, newbies may feel a little lost at first among the many buttons on the interface, and there are a lot of tasks to complete. But Anno 117: Pax Romana is one of the best management games we've ever played. Now let's hear what Caesar wants...\n\n-------------","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ou3b21/anno_117_pax_romana_review_thread/","permalink":"/r/Games/comments/1ou3b21/anno_117_pax_romana_review_thread/","score":266,"num_comments":107,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762846396.0,"edited":1762872529.0,"link_flair_text":"Review Thread","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

The integration of visuals, gameplay and sound is phenomenal, creating a wonderfully addictive puzzler that stands shoulder to shoulder with Enhance’s previous effort, Tetris Effect. It’s a stunning reminder of how games can move us, not just through challenge, but through the harmony of sight, sound, and touch.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Cat with Monocle](https://opencritic.com/outlet/785/cat-with-monocle)** - [Seth Hay](https://opencritic.com/critic/7446/seth-hay) - [4.5 / 5](https://catwithmonocle.com/news/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review/)\n\n>Lumines Arise shines with its blend of rhythm and dazzling puzzle experience. While its online options may feel limited, its accessibility customization and hypnotic flow keep players hooked. Lumines Arise is a perfect fit for those who are ready for a new style of puzzle-solving.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Simone Cantini](https://opencritic.com/critic/10829/simone-cantini) - *Italian* - [90 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/lumines-arise-326803/)\n\n>Lumines Arise isn’t just the return of a musical puzzle game—it’s a celebration of an idea that keeps evolving while honoring its roots. Enhance delivers an experience both familiar and surprising, with hypnotic rhythms and kaleidoscopic visuals. Easy to grasp in seconds yet captivating for hours, it becomes a true sensory immersion on PSVR2. Whether you’re a longtime fan or a curious newcomer, Lumines Arise invites you to play with music, dance with colors, and lose yourself in its world—where leaving won’t be easy.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Daily Mirror](https://opencritic.com/outlet/561/daily-mirror)** - [4 / 5 ](https://www.mirror.co.uk/gaming/lumines-arise-review-exceptional-vibes-36222732)\n\n>There are tracks in this that will stay with me for a very long time. All of which pair with astounding visuals that sees Lumines Arise primed to entrance and delight, firmly giving one of the best puzzle games ever the transformative makeover it deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[DualShockers](https://opencritic.com/outlet/285/dualshockers)** - [Jake Valentine](https://opencritic.com/critic/1117/jake-valentine) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.dualshockers.com/lumines-arise-review/)\n\n>Like Tetris Effect before it, Lumines Arise lives up to the franchise's legacy. It's slick, stylish, and as addictive as ever. Despite my complaints and critiques of the game, especially those level transitions that take you out of the rhythm you've established, I look forward to spending hundreds of hours with Lumines Arise over the next decade or so. There was nothing quite like Lumines back in the day, and even though there are similar titles available today in 2025, there's still only one Lumines. A must-own for any puzzle game fan.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer)** - [Christian Donlan](https://opencritic.com/critic/753/christian-donlan) - [4 / 5](https://www.eurogamer.net/lumines-arise-review)\n\n>From coconuts to black holes and watch parts, Lumines is back in fine voice.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameBlast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/797/gameblast)** - [Farley Santos](https://opencritic.com/critic/7342/farley-santos) - *Portuguese* - [9 / 10](https://www.gameblast.com.br/2025/11/lumines-arise-analise-review.html)\n\n>Lumines Arise is a triumphant return to one of the most unique puzzle series in gaming. While it doesn't reinvent the formula, it refines what was already brilliant by adding the Burst system and expanding content with various modes and flawless audiovisual direction. The game offers a rare balance between mental challenge and sensory calm in a synergistic experience. There are small flaws, like visually confusing levels and irregular matchmaking, but they barely detract from the overall strength. Ultimately, Lumines Arise is more than just a puzzle game—it's an immersive, rhythmic, and sensory experience, proving that when sound, image, and interaction come together with purpose, the result can be truly hypnotic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpew](https://opencritic.com/outlet/408/gamespew)** - [Kim Snaith](https://opencritic.com/critic/2755/kim-snaith) - [9 / 10](https://www.gamespew.com/2025/11/lumines-arise-review/)\n\n>Beautiful visuals and an excellent soundtrack collide in Lumines Arise, the latest entry in the long-running Lumines series. This block puzzle game is as timeless as Tetris, and as long as you can get your head around the strategies required here, it's going to keep you entertained for dozens upon dozens of hours.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GameSpot](https://opencritic.com/outlet/32/gamespot)** - [Diego Nicolás Argüello](https://opencritic.com/critic/4378/diego-nicol-s-arg-ello) - [8 / 10](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lumines-arise-review/1900-6418439/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f)\n\n>The concept of Tetris Effect is iterated on with confidence, paired with a singular use of technology that seeks to evoke emotion at every turn.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameliner](https://opencritic.com/outlet/767/gameliner)** - [Patrick Meurs](https://opencritic.com/critic/10557/patrick-meurs) - *Dutch* - [4.5 / 5 ](https://gameliner.nl/reviews/lumines-arise-review-een-meesterwerk-herboren/7176-1-1-18)\n\n>Some games are built on such a rock-solid foundation that they withstand the test of time without twisting themselves into innovative knots, and while it would be unfair to call Lumines Arise unoriginal, its simple yet fiendishly addictive gameplay loop still dazzles more than twenty years on—whether played solo, in co-op, or in VR—its hypnotic EDM beats and vibrant visuals flooding the senses in a spectacle that’s occasionally overwhelming but ultimately a feast of pure, synesthetic brilliance.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gamers Heroes](https://opencritic.com/outlet/467/gamers-heroes)** - [Casey Scheld](https://opencritic.com/critic/3399/casey-scheld) - [90 / 100](https://www.gamersheroes.com/honest-game-reviews/lumines-arise-review-timeline-cleanse/)\n\n>Music to our ears, Lumines Arise is a stellar puzzle game that provides the ultimate timeline cleanse.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-)** - [Oscar Taylor-Kent](https://opencritic.com/critic/3963/oscar-taylor-kent) - [4 / 5 ](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/puzzle/lumines-arise-review/)\n\n>It's an electric concept that works just as well in Lumines Arise as it does in Tetris Effect.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Kakuchopurei](https://opencritic.com/outlet/788/kakuchopurei)** - [Jonathan Toyad](https://opencritic.com/critic/7505/jonathan-toyad) - [80 / 100](https://www.kakuchopurei.com/2025/11/lumines-arise-review-kkp/)\n\n>[I]t's been ages since we've seen a puzzle game this beautiful since, well, Tetris Effect. Lumines Arise is simple yet deep with its tried-and-true 2x2 block-clearing mechanics, it has a few modes that not only educate you on playing the game better but also some co-op and competitive flair, and most importantly, it's a beauty to behold and listen to.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe)** - [James Davie](https://opencritic.com/critic/10192/james-davie) - [8.5 / 10](https://www.psu.com/reviews/lumines-arise-ps5-review/)\n\n>Suffices to say, If you haven't played Lumines before you're in for an exquisite audio/visual treat loaded with memorable and impacting vibes. Arise's soundtrack doesn't quite reach the majesty of Electronic Symphony on the Vita as the tunes can be too soft and not as emphatic, but in every other way Arise is the best Lumines game yet, and aptly bursts with life just as fervently as its new gameplay mechanic.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square)** - [Stephen Tailby](https://opencritic.com/critic/942/stephen-tailby) - [9 / 10](https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/lumines-arise)\n\n>Following up on the brilliant Tetris Effect was no easy feat, but Enhance has done it with Lumines Arise. At its core is an excellent puzzle game with lots of depth, and mechanics that gel perfectly with the emphasis on music and spectacular visuals. It's jam-packed with fun features that provide so many different ways to play, including series-best multiplayer and a great range of challenge modes. There are some very minor gripes if we're being really picky, but fans can rest assured that this is the big, flashy comeback Lumines deserves.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Seasoned Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/451/seasoned-gaming)** - [Steve Esposito](https://opencritic.com/critic/7516/steve-esposito) - [9 / 10](https://seasonedgaming.com/2025/11/11/review-lumines-arise-electronic-soup-for-the-soul/)\n\n>Lumines Arise is an incredibly emotional ride that holds onto you tightly and doesn't want to let go.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Shacknews](https://opencritic.com/outlet/62/shacknews)** - [Ozzie Mejia](https://opencritic.com/critic/278/ozzie-mejia) - [9 / 10](https://www.shacknews.com/article/146765/lumines-arise-review-score)\n\n>I have to confess that I'm more of a Tetris fanatic and haven't typically had an affinity for the Lumines series, but I will say that Arise is an absolute triumph. The visuals are some of Enhance's best, utilizing the best of both Unity and its own proprietary Synaesthesia Engine. It's wildly fun and unexpectedly challenging in places, but above all, it's a relaxing pleasure. Just sit back and let the beat drop.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TechRaptor](https://opencritic.com/outlet/329/techraptor)** - [Blair Bishop](https://opencritic.com/critic/10809/blair-bishop) - [8.5 / 10](https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lumines-arise-review-kraft-und-licht)\n\n>A nightmare to navigate, but you wake up to the most beautiful clash of non-intrusive puzzle gameplay, and fully realised visual design; the game Lumines was always meant to be.\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Dominic Leighton](https://opencritic.com/critic/307/dominic-leighton) - [9 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/)\n\n>Lumines Arise is the culmination of Mizuguchi's works, returning to his original creation and perfecting it. For fans of puzzle games, fans of Tetris Effect, or, indeed, fans of pure and evocative gaming experiences, this is essential.\n\n-------------\n\n**[VDGMS](https://opencritic.com/outlet/926/vdgms)** - [Darren Andrew](https://opencritic.com/critic/10907/darren-andrew) - [9 / 10](https://www.vdgms.com/reviews/lumines-arise-review)\n\n>If you’ve played Tetris Effect, this can be a really quick review because it’s essentially the same game, but with a Lumines twist which is a very good thing. Enhance Experience, the studio founded in 2014 by Lumines creator Tetsuya Mizaguchi, brings things full circle as Lumines Arise gets the same treatment that Tetris received in 2018, which gave the series a massive shot of adrenaline.\n>\n>Although the campaign failed to evoke complex emotional responses as intended, Lumines Arise features the same addicting, heart pumping, palm sweating gameplay full of flow states, psychedelic visuals, and hypnotic music in another transcendent experience from the studio.\n\n-------------","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ouagrv/lumines_arise_review_thread/","permalink":"/r/Games/comments/1ouagrv/lumines_arise_review_thread/","score":83,"num_comments":24,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762870374.0,"edited":1762879160.0,"link_flair_text":"Review Thread","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I’ve worked on Fruit Ninja, Jetpack Joyride, Steppy Pants, and more - AMA!","selftext":"Hello Video Game Enjoyers!\n\nI’m Stephen Last, a game developer from Melbourne, Australia, and one of the creators of [Spin Rhythm XD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1058830/Spin_Rhythm_XD/), an indie rhythm game available on PC, consoles, and VR.\n\nI’ve been making games since 2009, starting out at Halfbrick Studios, where I worked on Fruit Ninja, Jetpack Joyride, Age of Zombies, and more.\n\nIn 2015, I went indie after a brief stint at Pretty Great helping on Landsliders, then teamed up with Fruit Ninja artist Shath Maguire to create the casual mobile game Steppy Pants.\n\nIn 2017, we started an ambitious rhythm game project with longtime friend and Steppy Pants composer Dave Curro (u/daverwob), which eventually became Spin Rhythm XD.\n\nI’ll be here with our community manager u/waywtc123 answering questions for the next few hours (starting November 11 8:30am CST). It's past midnight here and we just launched our latest patch and DLC. It's an [Indie Pack](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677790/Spin_Rhythm_XD__Indie_Pack_DLC/?curator_clanid=35782014) filled with indie rock vibes from independent artists (mostly Australian based) and we're super excited to still be breathing life into the game this many years post release.\n\nAsk me anything about:\n\n🎮 Game development (indie or studio life)\n\n🎵 Designing rhythm games\n\n💿 Spin Rhythm XD (mechanics, music, VR, etc.)\n\n🌏 Working in the Australian games industry\n\n💡 Moving from big studios to indie\n\nFire away! I’m happy to chat about development tools, design challenges, weird bugs, or just how many times we’ve heard our own songs during testing.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ouaoaq/im_stephen_last_a_developer_on_spin_rhythm_xd_new/","permalink":"/r/Games/comments/1ouaoaq/im_stephen_last_a_developer_on_spin_rhythm_xd_new/","score":30,"num_comments":40,"over_18":false,"stickied":true,"created_utc":1762870919.0,"edited":1762871126.0,"link_flair_text":"Verified AMA","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
