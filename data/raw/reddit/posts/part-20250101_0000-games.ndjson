By allowing the player to foresee fights and predict their foes’ next moves, it turns what would be a by-the-numbers 2D fighting game into a more thoughtful experience built around memorisation, timing and strategy. While it drags anytime you have to claw yourself back following a game over, Forestrike makes up for it with its varied combat system and appealing aesthetics. If you’re a roguelike fan or an action fan, there’s a lot to like about Forestrike, and it’s certainly worth jumping into.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Entertainium](https://opencritic.com/outlet/751/entertainium)** - [Eduardo Rebouças](https://opencritic.com/critic/7136/eduardo-rebou-as) - [4 / 5 ](https://entertainium.co/2025/11/14/review-forestrike/)\n\n>Love it or hate it, Forestrike is a martial arts roguelite with a level of challenge that will kick your teeth in.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Gameffine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/854/gameffine)** - [Hemang Chauhan](https://opencritic.com/critic/11580/hemang-chauhan) - [80 / 100](https://www.gameffine.com/forestrike-review-mastering-the-deja-fu-roguelite)\n\n>Despite a steeper-than-usual learning curve, some balance issues, and dealing with bad RNG at the start, Forestrike is one of the few games where you feel like mastering a martial arts skill. There is a depth of tactics game, mixed with the reflexes of a fighting game and the innovative “Forsight mechanic”, making its gameplay stand out among its peers, and it should be commended. Those MA philosophies get corporate well into a story whose writing punches well above its weight compared to similar rogue-lites. This will certainly not be for everyone, but those with patience and a desire for mastery are sure to find a worthwhile experience.\n\n-------------\n\n**[GamingTrend](https://opencritic.com/outlet/102/gamingtrend)** - [70 / 100](https://gamingtrend.com/reviews/forestrike-review-striking-a-balance/)\n\n>Forestrike is an action rogue-like where players can practice every battle before it occurs by using the Foresight. This system in and of itself is fun, but the game can’t get out of its own way with unfair balancing that punishes the player regardless of performance. Even so, when the gameplay works, it works wonderfully, with an excellent sense of aesthetics and a strong story and characters to back it up.\n\n-------------\n\n**[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign)** - [Mitchell Saltzman](https://opencritic.com/critic/621/mitchell-saltzman) - [8 / 10](https://www.ign.com/articles/forestrike-review)\n\n>Forestrike's tactical martial arts inspired action does a wonderful job of combining combat and puzzle solving to make for a clever roguelite that will test your wits and reflexes in equal measure.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Loot Level Chill](https://opencritic.com/outlet/948/loot-level-chill)** - [Lyle Pendle](https://opencritic.com/critic/10579/lyle-pendle) - [8.5 / 10](https://lootlevelchill.com/reviews/forestrike-review/)\n\n>Forestrike is a fantastic martial arts Roguelike that rewards reflexes, with the incredibly clever ability to practice each fight before committing.\n\n-------------\n\n**[MKAU Gaming](https://opencritic.com/outlet/860/mkau-gaming)** - [Ashley Barnett-Cosgrove](https://opencritic.com/critic/10076/ashley-barnett-cosgrove) - [7 / 10](https://www.mkaugaming.com/all-review-list/forestrike-steam-review/)\n\n>Forestike is a good game, but I did not foresee the high level of patience and commitment required to complete it. Though I dream of a missed opportunity in visuals, the sound design was on point.\n>With a mountain of gameplay options to unpack with the Forestriker ability, Forestrike is fun, but you need to weigh up if the heightened difficulty and convoluted story are going to be too frustrating for you, as it was for me.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nintendo Blast](https://opencritic.com/outlet/774/nintendo-blast)** - [Alan Murilo Pereira Duque](https://opencritic.com/critic/7334/alan-murilo-pereira-duque) - *Portuguese* - [7 / 10](https://www.nintendoblast.com.br/2025/11/forestrike-switch-analise-critica-review.html)\n\n>Forestrike hits the mark in terms of fun, but falls short in the technical aspects, compromising a broader recommendation on the Switch. Still, if you enjoy solving increasingly complex puzzles and like roguelites that value creative mechanics, this game is worth checking out. Just be warned: on Nintendo's console, technical performance proves to be a powerful enemy—and, unfortunately, foresight wasn't enough to overcome it.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Nintendo Life](https://opencritic.com/outlet/136/nintendo-life)** - [Oliver Reynolds](https://opencritic.com/critic/4681/oliver-reynolds) - [7 / 10](https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/forestrike)\n\n>Overall, however, while Forestrike boasts strong gameplay and a lovely, abstract pixel-art aesthetic, its core hook removes a sense of risk. This is definitely a difficult game at its heart, but the ability to practise your runs with no consequences dulls its edge a bit too much.\n\n-------------\n\n**[NintendoBoy](https://opencritic.com/outlet/924/nintendoboy)** - [Lucas Barreto](https://opencritic.com/critic/10958/lucas-barreto) - *Portuguese* - [7.5 / 10](https://nintendoboy.com.br/2025/11/review-forestrike/)\n\n>Despite its flaws, I still believe Forestrike holds great value. The art is beautiful, simulating the shanshui style of the Ming dynasty, the combat is truly engaging, and I see a strong fit with players who enjoy SIFU, not only because of the theme but also because of the central ideas surrounding both titles.\n\n-------------\n\n**[PS4Blog.net](https://opencritic.com/outlet/441/ps4blog-net)** - EdEN - [8.5 / 10](https://www.ps4blog.net/2025/11/nintendo-switch-forestrike-review/)\n\n>Fun action roguelite inspired by classic martial arts movies\n\n-------------\n\n**[República DG](https://opencritic.com/outlet/974/rep-blica-dg)** - [André Custódio](https://opencritic.com/critic/11437/andr-cust-dio) - *Portuguese* - [8 / 100](https://republicadg.com.br/review-forestrike-pc/)\n\n>Aesthetically appealing and brutal in its combat, Forestrike fulfills its roguelite role well by rewarding creativity and persistence.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Screen Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/664/screen-rant)** - [Leo Faierman](https://opencritic.com/critic/5830/leo-faierman) - [8 / 10](https://screenrant.com/forestrike-review/)\n\n>Forestrike is a martial arts mix of crunchy roguelite systems.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Stryftek](https://opencritic.com/outlet/946/stryftek)** - [Ryan \"Stryftek\" Bullock](https://opencritic.com/critic/11093/ryan-stryftek-bullock) - [Worth your time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSBI-2TMN2M)\n\n>Chess meets Sifu - but can you checkmate?\n\n-------------\n\n**[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis)** - [Aran Suddi](https://opencritic.com/critic/308/aran-suddi) - [7 / 10](https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/13/forestrike-review/)\n\n>Forestrike is an entertaining blend of puzzle game and martial arts brawler, allowing you to experiment with different tactics. The different masters also provide variety with ability combinations that make each run unique. Running into some impossible fights that you simply can't beat and the crashing issue on Switch 2 do take some of the shine off the experience, though.\n\n-------------\n\n**[Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing)** - Christian - [8 / 10](https://worthplaying.com/article/2025/11/18/news/148269-pcswitch-review-forestrike/)\n\n>Forestrike is a ton of fun. It's easy to look at it and assume it's just another beat-'em-up, but the surprisingly rigid and strict rules of combat make it feel a lot more like a themed puzzled game than a standard action title. It's intensely satisfying to emerge victorious from difficult situations and seemingly overwhelming combat. Only a few balance issues drag down the game, but they're not that serious. Puzzle and beat-'em-up fans should give Forestrike a shot.\n\n-------------\n\n**[ZTGD](https://opencritic.com/outlet/97/ztgd)** - [Augusto A.](https://opencritic.com/critic/11118/augusto-a-) - [8 / 10](https://ztgd.com/reviews/forestrike-pc/)\n\n>Quote not yet available\n\n-------------","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1p6ghs2/forestike_review_thread_pc_switch/","permalink":"/r/Games/comments/1p6ghs2/forestike_review_thread_pc_switch/","score":32,"num_comments":5,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764087062.0,"edited":false,"link_flair_text":"Review Thread","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
