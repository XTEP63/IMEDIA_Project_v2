She pronounces is \"eye-leen\" so I asked her about it. Apparently it's a Turkish name and the way they pronounce it in BG3 is incorrect. She assumed that whoever decided on that name didn't do their research well enough, but then I found this out.   \n  \nI went to look up the name and learned some very cool things. Firstly, the first part of the name \"Ay\" is Turkish for \"moon.\" Then the second part of the name \"-lin\" means \"little\" or \"belonging to,\" which results in meanings like \"moonlight\" or \"moon halo.\" Very apropos. \n\nAnyway, I thought this was all pretty cool and I thought I'd share.

Triangle for Myrkul, Hand for Bane, Bleeding skull for Bhaal.\n\nMy understanding of the Dead Three is that they are very famous GREATER gods and clerics of them are known and feared throughout Fae'run. Bane's whole thing is that he spreads fear and infamy throughout the lands, so everyone should know of him. Bhaal and followers of Bhaal are widely known and feared for their need to murder others. Myrkul has one of the most important roles of any god, being the God of the Dead, and I'm under the understanding that Myrkulites are integral to all cities as caretakers of the dead. So I would imagine each of their sigils would be widely known out in the world.\n\nHow do the characters not even get a check to recognize the Absolute's sigil as relating to the Dead Three. How do all these people who worship the Absolute not realize they are following the Dead Three. They wear necklaces and sigils on them all with the sigil of the Dead Three!! Goblins should all know Bane because Bane in the lore has subjugated Maglubiyet (goblin god) before. Even if you ignore the hand and the bleeding, its literally a skull in a triangle the sigil of Myrkul.","url":"https://i.redd.it/kbk2ffk36drf1.png","permalink":"/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1nqgnao/did_people_not_notice_absolutes_icon_is_the_dead/","score":1089,"num_comments":143,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1758829680.0,"edited":1758829905.0,"link_flair_text":"Act 2 - Spoilers","is_self":false,"spoiler":true,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"spoiler"}
