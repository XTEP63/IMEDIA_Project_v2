I'm in Act 3 and I've been attempting my romance with Astarion. You know how he is. He confessed to me in Act 2. I rejected everyone else. Highest approval. Then Halsin comes in swinging with a big old confession of his own. I've seen *The* Cutscene on YouTube and I was like, oh this is it. However, you know he respectfully says let's talk to Astarion first because he has your heart. \n\nI wanted to see what would happen even tho I've been very true to Astarion. I went to him and he acted like he was okay with it, although he made sure it wasn't because we hadn't done it in a while. I reassured him he was special. I saved right before I answered Halsin, of course. So I played it out. Slept with Halsin. Did the whole thing. Went to him in the morning. Kissed on him. Blah blah blah. \n\nNow if this was me playing 180 hours ago, I wouldn't care and wanted to sleep with *everyone.* Well, after all this time I've really gotten attached to Astarion and IRL I'm very monogamous. And I'm very loyal. So, I scrubbed it and went back, then denied Halsin. \n\nI just- i think I'm losing touch with reality because I actually care about my decisions and not hurting this man. Even if he said he was okay with it, we all know his history of not being able to say no. So I felt like he really wasn't okay with it. I wish there was more conversation with Astarion about this and I wish he was more honest? Then again, I could just be reading into things too much and he really was okay with it. \n\nAnyone else feel this way? With any of the characters?

At some point I found the sanatorium, I convinced the madman to sacrifice himself, and took everything he had on him (including the lute). Then I remembered that Art’s quest asked me to investigate the place, so I did it — a lot — and picked up every possible item. Eventually I got tired of it and went on to do other things; by chance I talked to Halsin, so he went to the Inn with Art. Finally I figured that since the man was singing, I should try playing some music to him, so I tried with the music box: no response. Then I tried playing the lute: no response.\nHalsin doesn't give me any option to play the lute nor mentions it, he only urges me to find a solution.\nObviously I got fed up and came to Reddit, I found a post from two years ago with people saying they had the same problem… but I couldn’t find a propet solution in the replies.

Recently, my partner and I have started our second run (well, my second, my partner is a veteran of the franchise). We have encountered some modding issues that have left us unable to progress our game, and we are long-distance, so this is having a significant impact on our ability to spend time together. We would love more than anything if you, the community, could help us figure out where we have gone wrong!\n\n\tHere are the parameters of our modding (screenshots of the mod list will be attached): We did not encounter any issues during Act One; however, during Act Two, we ran into a problem when loading the game. While trying to load hard saves, which we don't have many of, to avoid the 222 error, the game freezes at 83% and can't load further. We removed all mods and select mods (select modding pertaining to our most recent downloads) at different times, and all together at once, but both yielded the same result when relaunching the game. We got the 222 error even though, as stated previously, we avoid over-saving to avoid the wrath of the dreaded 222. \n\n\tAfter this continuous crashing, we deleted the script extender history and mod settings from the files. We also removed all mods from the mod folder and then verified game files. Lastly, we put the mods back in, installed an updated script extender, loaded our oldest save (which was not very far back), and it worked until we closed the game again, at which point we encountered the same error upon relaunching the next time we wanted to play. I also want to note that we have only attempted to load hard saves. Can anyone please help shine some light on what we could try based on this and the attached mod list?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c6sl1xtt8h3g1.png?width=1335&format=png&auto=webp&s=8387ef9460ab409e3513ca67449f45e8064e2eb9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zvppleu8h3g1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=93d9d7d16a472bec0ca4df058136550c5d767527\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1p6q7ey/baldurs_gate_modding_issues_please_help/","permalink":"/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1p6q7ey/baldurs_gate_modding_issues_please_help/","score":1,"num_comments":0,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764108731.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Mods / Modding","is_self":true,"spoiler":true,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"spoiler"}

I'm a bit into Act 3 (got Minsc, killed Auntie Ethel and done a few more smaller stuff in the city) and recently started using Boots of Stormy Clamour and Gloves of Belligerent Skies on her and wow, it's so good. I mean, I was using the boots with my Dark Urge Sorcerer and found it useful but giving it to Shadowheart and using it together with Spirit Guardians is on a whole new level, reverberating not a single enemy but groups of it and I can only assume that it would be extremely effective against undead with Blood of Lathander, but what else can I add to it? Thunderskin Cloak seems like it would've been nice but I'm using Displacer Cloak which is in fact the reason I now started using these items with her as she is now able to keep Spirit Guardians thanks to the cloak instead of losing concentration so often.
