The title was something along the lines of “Maid to a Princess“ or “Maiden To A Princess”. That might not even be the title but I remember being read something along those lines regarding the title out loud to me by my grandma. It looked like an old old anime style animated short clip from a movie or show that involved a kind looking princess with long black hair who seemed to be loved especially by a little girl in the beginning. Then the princess is outside late at night in the courtyard and then her eyes all of a sudden turn red. Then a sinister looking woman emerges from the shadows with a long kind of blade. You hear the princess scream, and then you see her nude body (with none of the NSFW parts being shown though) being carried away by the woman, possibly to a tower as we see that’s where the woman was looking at. And the last shot you saw was her red eyeballs on the floor after being cut out. Not even bloody or anything. Just that the woman had cut them out and they were still red-colored.\n\nIt might be a really really old movie but I know I didn’t dream it because I remember vividly my grandparents and parents reading the title out loud to me so I knew what not to watch.

You might remember that I said Digimon Xros Wars Seasons 1 and 2 were pretty good.  They weren't masterpieces or groundbreaking or anything like that, but I thought they were very enjoyable.  They managed to blend tropes from Super Sentai/Power Rangers, Digimon, and late 2000s/early 2010s battle shonen anime and did way better than I thought would have been possible.  It also reminded me tonally and in characterization of Digimon Adventure 01 and 02, which I appreciated too.  But season 3 was a huge step down.  it's not terrible.  It's not even the worst Digimon installment that I've seen during this marathon.  It just seems like what they had for this installment ran out of steam by this point.  There were some fun things here.  I did like the main protagonist, Tagiru Akashi.  This is another way that this season is similar to Digimon Adventure 01 and 02 in that it does change the main character, although unlike that the previous main character, Taiki Kudou, is still a prominent character here.  But anyways Tagiru does have a lot of energy and he has enjoyable moments.  But overall the amount of enjoyable moments are few and far between here, so much so that the ones it did have couldn't save it for me, even though it's only 25 episodes long.  I just thought it was kind of meh honestly.

Only now have I decided to dive deeper into the anime world. \n\nAnd I'm shocked halfway through the new anime I've started. It's called Heavenly Delusion and I saw it recommended on social media. While the plot is great, there are many sexual undertones even though the main characters are almost all underage or at least they appear so. Also, why are there two instances of a brother confessing to his sister (though in one, they weren't real siblings, but he did call her sis though). \n\nWhy is there a girl who appears to be hardly 13 running a hotel and makes money by sleeping with the customers she likes? \n\nOh, and the gender confusion. I feel like it is intentional and there are queer undertones, it is not explicitly mentioned. Now why would I think a character was clearly a guy until he takes off his shirt to make out with another guy (I was so happy, I love queer stuff) until they turn out to have boobs!  \n\nIs it just specific to this anime because the ones I watched previously weren't like this, or perhaps is it a genre difference. I can never wrap my head around all the elusive genre names. \n\nI really like the plot and wouldn't want to drop it because of all this because well, I have my fair share of morbid curiosity but is it how animes are like or am I reading too much into the lines and should just enjoy the plot?

Plus the animation and artwork is just really good in general. I also lovvve the small town horror aspect, and the heavy contrast that is shown both visually and in the writing of very bland town vs intense horror. \n\nBut I’m so frustrated with the pacing and their attempts at suspense. I wish they leaned harder into leading with Yoshiki discovering hikarus dead body, and then not knowing how he came back. I wish there had been a mystery of “what happened to Hikaru?” For more than the beginning of the first episode. I feel like they jumped straight into it not being Hikaru. While I’m glad that they aren’t overdoing it with filler content, it still feels very fast and like I missed out on what could’ve been an interesting experience. \n\nBefore I say this part, I want to reiterate that this is my mid season review and I’m expecting my end review to be different. But so far I feel like despite “mystery” being the shows whole thing they are really bad at it. Yoshiki is surrounded by people who clearly know more than they are letting on. The answer CONSTANTLY feels a word away and like they are just drawing it out, which feels ironic considering how quickly they revealed what Hikaru is. I feel like it’s just reflective of poor storytelling. \n\nIn AOT, you had NO idea what was going on. But at no point during it did I feel this agitated about it. You weren’t constantly an inch away from the answer, and it felt well paced. In attack on titan it felt like a fun ride, here it just feels like I’m watching to scratch an itch. It reminds me of like tiktoks or reels or something. It’s not told well, it’s just designed to keep you wanting to watch. It uses jarring visual effects and immediate twists to get you hooked, and then it slowly shows that it doesn’t really care about whether or not you like it, but if you are watching. \n\nIt kinda reminds me of kpop demon hunters. I personally didn’t like it. It felt like a perfect example of Netflix’s love of “second screen” content. I really hope I’m proved wrong and feel stupid about this review by the end of the season.
