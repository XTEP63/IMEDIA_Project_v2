I don't understand how events are not sequential regardless of perception.","selftext":"I searched the sub previously, but still don't understand some of the language of the explanations. A previous one had the scenario where myself and a friend in Norway clap at the same time: suppose we both synchronize watches according an atomic clock and agree at a set time per UDT we clap, and then do, to the observer flying past with FTL communication from their perspective the friend in Norway claps first, and if they instantly tell me this the information arrives before the event that triggered it happened.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how the sequence of events can be subjective, instead of the PERCEPTION of the events.  My issue with the previous explanation is that if we are clapping at the same time, then we both clap. The light from my friend clapping reaches the observer first, but light and information carrying my own clapping has also already begun, since we have arranged to clap simultaneously: we have accounted for our locations relative to one another and the planet's motion in our timing, let us say perfectly so. Each of us from our perspective claps at that same moment.\n\nLet us say Dr. Manhattan appears inside the earth, precisely midway between us, and sees through the land to look at us directly, and watches us at the same time: he sees the reflected light bounce off us when we clap and head in his direction at the same time, the same speed.\n\nFrom his perspective, looking both ways at once, wouldn't it appear to be synchronized?\n\nLet's say further Dr. Manhattan agrees to tell us via light-speed communications who he sees clap first, or if it appears at the same time.  \n\nHe would eventually say \"You both have clapped at the same time.\"\n\nWouldn't the observer still be bound by causality despite FTL travel of information? \n\nSure, they can radio me via instant comms and say \"Your friend in Norway clapped\" the instant they see it, but by then I have clapped and my light is on its way to both him and Dr. Manhattan.\n\nTime dilation and FTL comms would allow him to say \"Your friend in Norway clapped\" before seeing me do it, and before Dr. Manhattan could tell me anything, but wouldn't it still be after I had clapped? Clearly I'm missing something but I don't understand how it breaks causality. The limiting factor in \"real life\" instead of a thought experiment is that you would need greater than infinite energy to travel beyond light speed and communicate or interact, which is impossible for its own reasons.\n\nWhat am I not understanding about \"relativity of simultaneity\" here? I accept that FTL comms are impossible as we understand physics, I just don't understand it. I can't find a good example that clarifies WHY it is impossible.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1p6od0q/eli5_after_searching_the_previous_answers_about/","permalink":"/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1p6od0q/eli5_after_searching_the_previous_answers_about/","score":0,"num_comments":12,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764104437.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Physics","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
