The beta is out today!\n\nIndus Automation is a modpack inspired by Captain of Industry, Factorio and GregTech. You start Minecraft normally, but the goal is to slowly build bigger factories and automate everything.\n\nMachines are large multiblocks that build themselves, so you don't have to spend time building them but you're free to change them if you want.\n\nIn the beta (Chapters 1 and 2), you’ll:\n\n• Build structures like the Tree Farm, Quarry, Mixer, Crusher, Pump, ...\n\n• Smelt ores into plates using a Blast Furnace.\n\n• Use carts and pipes to move resources around.\n\n• Produce concrete slabs, dusts and early construction parts.\n\n• Set up pumps, steam power and energy networks.\n\n• Automate Construction Part 1 and Construction Part 2.\n\n• Unlock AE2 with custom recipes.\n\nRight now the pack takes about 12-15 hours to finish what’s implemented. Later chapters (oil, electronics, servers, quantum tech) are coming.\n\nIf you're into automation, give it a try. It's also very light-weight.\n\nYou can download it on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/indus-automation).","url":"https://i.redd.it/nsb1ujt1af3g1.png","permalink":"/r/feedthebeast/comments/1p6fiyk/indus_automation_beta_is_out_captain_of_industry/","score":66,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764084903.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"I made something","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/s5fg6Mc1ho_5wAHfn_rBtvtb2dnb7Aj5J6BR7TCHa_4.jpg"}

I'm on 1.21 at the moment. I'm looking to upgrade to 1.21.1, but this guy simply isn't posting any updates to this mod anymore. I even DM'd him last July and asked him to update it, and I got no response.\n\nI have way too much stuff inside these compact barrels. If I upgrade to 1.21.1 now, I'm going to lose an astronomical amount of resources.\n\nOne of the most important features of this mod is the fact that it lets me \"retain\" a barrel's inventory whenever I pick it up. It's like a shulker box, but even better, because I can place this box inside another box that is also retaining, and another and another and another. This means that I have an infinite regress of portable storage in as little as one cub meter. \n\nThat's the most important feature I need for my new mod. However, I'd also like it if the mod also had massive storage in each barrel. With Compact Storage, it starts with 9x6 (the storage capacity of a large chest but only taking up a single block) and I can upgrade it to as much as 21x12. This is less important than the infinite regress of portable storage, though. It's mostly just so I don't lose resources if I leave the AFK farm overnight, is all. \n\nThe mod needs to be compatible with 1.21.1 (because DUH), but I'd prefer if it were also compatible with 1.21, so I can simply transfer all my resources to the new mod in 1.21 before upgrading to 1.21.1. But this is the least important of the three, since I can still use the \"endless inventory\" mod by Kww_sayaka to temporarily transfer my storage. \n\nDoes anyone have any mod suggestions?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1p6kq1j/i_need_a_mod_similar_to_compactstorage_by/","permalink":"/r/feedthebeast/comments/1p6kq1j/i_need_a_mod_similar_to_compactstorage_by/","score":1,"num_comments":8,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764096354.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Looking for mod(s)","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Things requiring 5000j and above.\n\nNow once I got my first material up to 2500m/s I realised that getting the electrical power to **double** this speed was unfeasible. But I don't need to have a particle going 5km/s if I could just have two particles going opposite directions since their energy is combined.\n\nSo I built a second ring beside the first and created an offshoot wherein I could tell one ring to slip onto the other ring in the opposite direction and yes, a collision would happen. In this first model the collision almost always occured on the corner, in the first block where the particles could possibly colllide.\n\nThen to recoup the energy I wanted tachyon collectors nearby, but being built on a corner that was hard. I couldn't fit as many as I wanted. So I moved the ring so that when the trigger is pulled, both would exit in a straight line and collide. But now the actual collision is not occuring in the middle.\n\nI've got the system setup such that the redstone signal to release them both should occur on both rings at the same time, but evidently it matters where on the ring the particle is because I've tested this three times and I've gotten a different collision point every single time. Wildly so (Blue marks on map).\n\nI have since refined my sensor triggers, moved the sensors so they're equal distance from the breakpoint on each ring, and created a synchronous input device. This has somewhat stablized where the collisions happen but it's still not where I want it to be every time (Orange X).\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/1p69yj5/how_can_i_coordinate_two_oritech_particle/","permalink":"/r/feedthebeast/comments/1p69yj5/how_can_i_coordinate_two_oritech_particle/","score":1,"num_comments":0,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764069691.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
