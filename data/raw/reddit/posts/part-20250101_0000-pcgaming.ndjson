To get you un idea of what it looks like, it's a combination of:\n- Total war/Mount and blade/Tooth and Tail army control\n- For honor/Dark Souls/Guilty Gear 2 Overture 3D fighting mechanics\n\nThis game mixes the concept of controling an army as an individual, telling formations, advance, engage, retreat, flank an such like we see in games like Total war RTS gameplay and the battles of Mount and Blade, with the intense action oriented fighting style and power fantasy of being a powerful being in battle.\n\nAll games mentioned focus on one side of the action, with the exception of Overture, as that game is a MOBA with fighting game mechanics. Despite being a very niche genre, I noticed a lack of such games due to being hard to develop.\n\nI wonder, is there truly a small market for such games, or am I reading it wrong?\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1p6il7u/fighting_action_army_game/","permalink":"/r/pcgaming/comments/1p6il7u/fighting_action_army_game/","score":0,"num_comments":12,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764091684.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
