It also quickly became \"Not Available.\"\n\nIn the interest of actual wider discussion though, I'm curious about artists and merch...is there anyone else who does merch on this scale? It's so extreme. I saw this article and it made me go look at her website and she's basically got an entire Temu/Walmart/Homegoods store of merch, I've never seen anything like it.\n\nWhat is an artist's responsibility when it comes to fans and merch? Is there one? Is there a discernable line where people are being taken advantage of, where it becomes predatory? Or do we just say, \"Who cares, people buy what they want, if they want to be foolish with their money, that's their problem.\"?\n\nOn the flip side, is there an artist you think is particularly killing it at merch, as in you've found them to provide high quality, well thought out items?
