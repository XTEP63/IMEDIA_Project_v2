I’m hearing that “Starting 5” is getting benched after a two-season run on Netflix.\n\n> The NBA-focused effort tracked five players over the course of the season, and even with a fortuitous ending with two of its characters reaching the seven-game NBA Finals (Pacers G Tyrese Haliburton and Thunder G Shai Gilgeous-Alexander), the audience just wasn’t there to keep the show going. Rockets F Kevin Durant, Clippers G James Harden and Celtics F Jaylen Brown were also featured in Season 2, while Lakers F LeBron James, Kings F Domantas Sabonis, Warriors G Jimmy Butler, T’Wolves G Anthony Edwards and Celtics F Jayson Tatum were featured in Season 1. Omaha Productions, James’ SpringHill Co. and Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground were executive producers on the show.\n\n> Netflix’s first batch of internal data for “Starting 5” Season 2 won’t be available until early 2026, but as noted by the Entertainment Strategy Guy, various third-party numbers weren’t looking good for the series. Internal Season 1 numbers from Netflix during the second half of 2024 were well behind the NFL docuseries “Quarterback,” and that trend was likely continued in the back of half of this year with both series’ second seasons.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1p6fl5d/sbj_netflixs_starting_5_has_been_cancelled/","permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1p6fl5d/sbj_netflixs_starting_5_has_been_cancelled/","score":2798,"num_comments":527,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764085039.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Lively missed 36 consecutive games last season and needed surgery despite Nico Harrison saying he wouldn’t. Lively will be extension eligible this Summer.","selftext":"Source: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6837371/2025/11/25/dereck-lively-injury-mavericks-foot-status/?source=user_shared_article\n\n> Dallas Mavericks center Dereck Lively II is experiencing “swelling and discomfort” in his right foot and will miss the Mavericks’ next three games, at minimum, the team announced Tuesday.\n\n> Last season, Lively was sidelined for 36 consecutive games with what the Mavericks referred to as a stress fracture in his right ankle. In April, then-Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison said he didn’t believe Lively would need offseason surgery. That ended up being inaccurate, as Lively underwent surgery over the summer to remove bone spurs in his right foot.\n\n> Lively, who is eligible for a contract extension this summer, has provided two-way impact as a rim-running, shot-blocking center. His career averages are 8.4 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game. But injuries have limited him to 98 games played in his three-year career.\n\n> Last February, the Mavericks traded for Anthony Davis with the idea of playing him heavily at power forward alongside Lively in twin-tower lineups. So far, Davis and Lively have played just 79 minutes together. Davis, who has been out since Oct. 29 with a left calf strain, is expected to practice on Wednesday.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1p6ns6o/clark_dereck_lively_ii_is_experiencing_swelling/","permalink":"/r/nba/comments/1p6ns6o/clark_dereck_lively_ii_is_experiencing_swelling/","score":296,"num_comments":122,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764103140.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
