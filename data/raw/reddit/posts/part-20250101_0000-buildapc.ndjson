I typically only upgrade my system every 6-8 years, so this feels like a big decision.\n\nI wasn’t planning to buy a GPU right now, but a friend mentioned that prices might go up again due to the ongoing chip shortages and the AI hardware boom. He suggested I consider picking one up during Black Friday before any potential price increases especially since AMD announced a production cut a few days ago.\n\nMy original plan was to wait about a year before upgrading the GPU, but now I’m wondering whether it’s better to stretch my budget a bit and lock in a decent price now, rather than risk paying more later.\n\nFor context, I play mostly non-demanding or moderately demanding games: League of Legends, Minecraft, various indie titles, and some FPS games like Overwatch, Battlefield, and Marvel Rivals.\n\nMy current card is an ASUS ROG STRIX 2060 SUPER 8GB, and I’ve been considering the RTX 5070 Ti as a potential upgrade.\n\nIf you were in my position, would you buy the 5070 Ti now, or would you wait?

We need an on-premise server for local AI tasks (LLM inference, TTS, STT). We can't afford a full Enterprise Threadripper/EPYC + A100 setup, so we are trying to build a powerful \"consumer\" workstation to act as a server.\n\n**The Goal:** A machine capable of running two RTX 4090s for inference requests. It needs to stay on 24/7, though it won't be running at 100% load all the time (bursty workloads based on API calls).\n\nHere is an example of the parts list we have available in our region (Build example):\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 9 9950X\n* **Motherboard:** ASUS ProArt X670E-Creator WiFi (Chosen because it supports x8/x8 PCIe Bifurcation from the CPU).\n* **GPUs:** 2x RTX 4090 (likely MSI Gaming Trio or ASUS TUF/ROG depending on stock).\n* **RAM:** 96GB Kit (2x 48GB) Corsair Vengeance DDR5 6400MHz (Planning to downclock to 5600/5200 for stability).\n* **Storage:** Samsung 990 PRO 2TB NVMe.\n* **PSU:** Corsair AX1600i Titanium (1600W).\n* **Case:** Corsair 7000D Airflow (White).\n* **CPU Cooler:** Arctic Liquid Freezer III 420mm.\n* **UPS:** We are adding a 3000VA APC/Eaton UPS.\n\nWe know that fitting two thick 4090s on a standard ATX motherboard is physically difficult due to slot spacing. We want to avoid thermal throttling on the top card.  \n**Our Plan:**\n\n1. **Top GPU:** Mounted horizontally in the first PCIe slot.\n2. **Bottom GPU:** Mounted **vertically** using the Corsair 7000D vertical slots + a high-quality shielded **PCIe 4.0 Riser Cable**.\n3. A lot of ventilation.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. Is the \"1 Horizontal + 1 Vertical\" setup viable for a workstation/server environment? We are worried about the riser cable adding instability.\n2. **Power Limiting:** We plan to power limit both cards to \\~70% (approx 300-315W) to manage thermals and longevity. Is this recommended for production inference?\n\nAny advice or \"red flags\" before we pull the trigger would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1p6hs56/build_help_building_a_2x_rtx_4090_ai_server_for_a/","permalink":"/r/buildapc/comments/1p6hs56/build_help_building_a_2x_rtx_4090_ai_server_for_a/","score":2,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764089918.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Build Help","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

It took me a while to figure out that it was due to the GPU overheating and not being able to cool itself properly, all because of the vertical mount. SSUPD even has an [FAQ ](https://support.ssupd.co/en/support/solutions/articles/151000216147-gpu-temperatures-without-reverse-gravity-heatpipes-in-xhuttle-vertical-mount)entry for this issue.\n\n**FYI:** I tested 2 different GPUs (AMD & Nvidia), and it happened with both.

Which GPUs in the price range of 500–800 € use this technology or are known to work well in such a setup? I'm not interested in modding the case with custom water cooling or anything like that.

I know 850w is probably overkill for the parts atm, but it could leave a little more headroom for future upgrades?\n\n  \nAs for the SSD, I just did some searching on this subreddit and found the SN5000 is a good budget 2TB SSD. Is there a better option within the same price range?\n\nI do know there are MUCH cheaper coolers, I just liked the aesthetic of the DRP5 and wanted an air cooler over an AIO.\n\n  \n... and yes, I am dreading the cable management with the Fractal case, but again, I just loved the aesthetic!\n\n  \nThoughts?\n\n\n\n[PCPartPicker Part List](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/wMGxnp)\n\n|Type|Item|Price|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**CPU**|[AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D 4.2 GHz 8-Core Processor](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/3hyH99/amd-ryzen-7-7800x3d-42-ghz-8-core-processor-100-100000910wof)|£325.97 @ Amazon UK|\n|**CPU Cooler**|[be quiet!

Coming from a B450 Tomahawk I kinda enjoyed MSI, but wondering the the Gigabyte one is higher quality.
