But let's be real: the current meta is a nightmare of constant world hopping just to find active double spots (barracuda, fremmy, merchant, you name it). Shipwrecks despawn too quick, boats need repositioning every 3 mins, and you're burning time hopping 10+ worlds for that perfect setup. The main problem here is shipwrecks won't respawn until another in the area despawns. \n\nWhy settle for this when we can designate World 486 as the Unofficial AFK Salvaging World. \n\nThe idea here is to have people afk salvaging at every shipwreck in the area so they naturally despawn/respawn and rotate between us. This will maximize our afk to 30 mins at a time while still getting amazing exp from high level shipwrecks. \n\nPicture this:\n- Mass players on double spots = constant active wrecks, no hopping needed\n- Share BiS Shipreck locations for every level\n- AFK crews linking up with 2x hooks + crewmates for max efficiency (110k+ XP/hr merchant vibes)\n- Newbies find spots easily, vets optimize with crystal extractors without babysitting\n\nJMods have done it for PvM worlds, blast mine, etc. – this would make Sailing even more accessible and fun without touching core mechanics. \n\nTo kick it off: \n- Salvage on World 486, afk or not! \n- Join the 'afksalvaging' cc RIGHT NOW!\n\nLet's make salvaging the smoothest grind in OSRS.

I have participated in most available content aside from sea monster hunting. \n\nBarracuda Trials - The XP feels great from all three tiers. In my opinion you SHOULD be rewarded with the highest xp available from doing a method that requires constant attention. Huge W jagex. The only negative is I wish there was more than 3 trials AND the gwen trial should give some kind of loot?\n\nSalvaging - Huge W. The gameplay loop feels nice. You have the option of 2T salvage, manually salvaging, or letting your crew do the work for you. My only complaint is your crew should have the same range as your character, sometimes you have to park your boat in odd configurations in order for them to be \"in range\". Also the sailing plugin that hides their overhead text is also nice lol\n\nDelivery Tasks - To be fair, I haven't done much of this. I did the early levels like everyone else, but aside from unlocking the first barracuda trial, I never touched it since. I could (should) see this being higher XP an hour then salvaging because of the constant attention required. Maybe there is a good xp route? IDK\n\n  \nSea Monster Bounty Tasks - Did a few of them, drop rates seem inconsistent.  Some people found cannon spots to do them? Seems weird that any weapon other then your cannons are good for killing any sea monster. I cannot picture people using rune cannonballs or higher unless your filthy rich. Perhaps your cannon shots should only have a 20% chance to deplete a cannon ball, similar to an accumulator? IDK\n\nCharting - F\\*\\*K the sea charting duck. It was cool the first time, that is all I have to say.\n\nWish List - The ability to completely hide your mast and sails. \n\nHarvesting the crystal extractor should be a button on your boat UI\n\nCompletely hide other peoples boats and their animations of picking up crates at the trials (maybe entity hider will have an option for this). \n\nRapids unlocked from charting are placed in weird spots?

Mounted Ballista (Facility) - Would open ocean combat styles to a smash (cannon) and pierce (ballista) weakness. Also, could add a javelin + rope + net attachment, and have a crewmate work a corpse recovery station. \n\n3. Shipwright services - Add an option for the shipwright to fully repair your ship for a fee. Nobody wants to buy 73 basic repair kits and spam them. Additionally on the repair note, maybe allow a crewmember to repair a ship repeatedly. Yelling at Jobless Jim to repair my ship and watching him repair to a state of 70/160 and stop makes me realize why he's Jobless. \n\n4. Official Salvage Worlds - The more people salvaging the better. Faster respawns for those who are afk, rather than an unsalvaged ship sitting alone for a few minutes on the side.\n\n5. Bötgttr- Freminikk boat salvage replacement.

With the crewmates max hit and normal combat nerf, its faster just to use the cannon yourself, monsters like kraken can be attacked with two cannons at once which is okay, but still its pretty slow and the crewmate rarely hits.\n\nI think combat should just be normal on boats, not reduced, so i can use mage to kill kraken and cannons as additional dps.\n\nAlso it would be cool if there was a way to transfer repair kits to your boat faster, unless there is a way that im unaware of. Its a pain to run to the boat with a full invy of kits, board the boat/deposit, go back to the bank for other gear/more kits.

Additionally RS has generally always felt like I can log out anywhere at any time and not be punished. This is no longer the case with sailing as logging out in the middle of the ocean risks losing cargo and having to pay for recovery. The freedom of being able to put osrs down at any time is slightly tainted by the fact that before I log off I need to find a mooring point, and remember to dock before jumping off.  \n\n\nSuggestion: On land we get a 15min gravestone timer to collect our items when we die. My suggestion is that when out boat is lost or recovered, instead of deleting the cargo completely can we get a pile of flotsam in the ocean where our boat was lost that has all our cargo in it to recollect if we desire.  \noptional: allow me to recollect cargo from an NPC for a fee (death? posidon?) the same way we recollect items on death.","url":"https://i.redd.it/r6t360vvsh3g1.png","permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/1p6syos/suggestion_flotsam_as_ocean_gravestones_for_cargo/","score":43,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764115704.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Suggestion","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/l4DNoGa_jMahTS7sBNFsCT04Q8-9WwEW6XFnyvMJ8Oo.jpg"}
{"id":"1p6dqi1","name":"t3_1p6dqi1","subreddit":"2007scape","author":"NotTheBeeze","title":"More Deep Sea Trawling Testing + How to Set Up","selftext":"Deep Sea Trawling continues to be the least explored new sailing method so I just thought I'd add my findings. This is a follow up on u/LuxOG's [post on trawling](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1p4kg0w/one_hour_of_deep_sea_trawling_gameplay_452/) so I'll focus on what else I've found.\n\nAfter getting familiar with the method I did 2 dedicated testing hours north of Relekka on the Marlin Shoal. \n\n1 hour of \"relaxed\" just moving spot to spot and adjusting rope heights. 1 hour of focused constant clicking of the net.\n\n**Here's the ideal boat set up I used:**  \nBest Hull, Sails, Helm + Keel (Doesn't matter much but I was on Ironwood/Rune Tier)  \nEternal Brazier is mandatory  \n2 Cotton Trawling Nets at front of boat.  \nChum Station next to port side net  \nCrystal Extractor next to starboard side net  \nA fathom stone, keg and wind/gale catcher at the back. Placement shouldn't matter\n\nCrew:  \nJenkins on Net  \nJobless Jim on Chum Station  \nAnyone on Helm  \nAnyone on Repairs once you're level 85\n\nI'd also recommend filling the keg with Trawler's Trust, making fish crates with Camphor Plank, Adamant Nails and Ice Cooler, and bringing some repair kits.\n\n**Here are my rates and loot at 84 Sailing / 91 Fishing:**  \n**No Spam Clicking Hour**  \n39.6k Sailing  \n19.3k Fishing  \n223 Marlin  \n47 Bluefin\n\n**Spam Clicking Hour**  \n46.8k Sailing XP  \n33.8k Fishing XP  \n362 Marlin  \n38 Bluefin  \n1 Swift Marlin  \n1 Soup\n\nI think you could get slightly more xp on both methods with a higher fishing level. It also really started to click a ways into the second hour so the gap between them could be smaller than I experienced.\n\n**Some Tips:**\n\n* The Crystal Extractor does not interrupt trawling. Just click it on cooldown every time. This accounts for around 30k of an hour's sailing xp. \n* You use around 60 Offcuts per hour, I forgot to check exact numbers \n* I'd highly recommend setting up the text to speech Watchdog alerts seen in LuxOG's video, he has the import strings in the comments. \n* You can catch fish that are right at the back of the boat. It's better to try stay ahead of the shoal.\n* Similarly, you want to set sail just before the shoal is due to move\n* I personally control everything I can through the sailing interface except for leaving a shoal.\n\n**Opinion:**  \nThe method is really fun. The spam clicking version is very intense but rewarding. The relaxed version isn't very relaxed, it requires constant attention but you can definitely get a podcast or YouTube vid on the side.\n\nThe amount of fish you get is crazy, for Ironmen this is something you'll only need to do a few hours a month to keep your BIS food stocked up. Probably will remain good money for normal accounts.\n\nConversely, the amount of XP you get is dreadful. Pre-release I was planning to do this to 99 Fishing, but that would take 100s of hours.\n\nI like that this method is active since it's rewards are so good, but I at least think we should be getting xp per fish for when the double catch triggers, and even then I still think it would be a bad xp method. Right now, the dedicated AFK option of salvaging is still better total xp than this split skill, high focus method, pair that with AFK Karambwan fishing and it's around the same total xp/h with a fraction of the focus.\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1p6dqi1/more_deep_sea_trawling_testing_how_to_set_up/","permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/1p6dqi1/more_deep_sea_trawling_testing_how_to_set_up/","score":40,"num_comments":45,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764080677.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

{"id":"1p6mcs4","name":"t3_1p6mcs4","subreddit":"2007scape","author":"Chaosike","title":"Sailing UI Improvements","selftext":"I'll start off by saying that I have enjoyed sailing so far. I feel like the UI could do with some improvements.\n\n  \nCurrently the UI is a bit clunky and overcrowded with information that you do not need while actually sailing. Below is the current UI that you are familiar with:\n\n[Current UI](https://preview.redd.it/hag9s12zfg3g1.png?width=363&format=png&auto=webp&s=1abbd59bdb4947015531702a44a63d1cee89237f)\n\nFrom switching to this tab, you can see a total of 4 work stations. I am currently unable to see my second cannon and my two salvaging stations meaning that the scroll bar is needed if you are changing crew around.\n\nI have put a proposal together which slightly moves the interface around to allow for 6 ½ stations to be displayed when switching to the sailing tab.\n\n[Sailing UI Proposal Scrolled Up](https://preview.redd.it/y1mbftvegg3g1.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=25193aff441a5decdc46cb2e56839b7ed69cbf41)\n\n[Sailing UI Proposal Scrolled Down](https://preview.redd.it/fmrawemogg3g1.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=603bd5c64cdfa816e60da1eb8192b3a5e4a0ad4c)\n\nIt also includes buttons at the bottom to open up the stats & crew (which are currently tabs) along with a button to open the captains log without needing the book in your inventory (similar to the collection log update). This was aimed to match the \"Worn Equipment\" screen style.\n\nAlso, repairing your ship with a crew member consists of needing to constantly assign a crew member to that position. The current steps are:\n\n1. Go to sailing tab\n\n2. Click Assign next to Repairs\n\n3. Select crew member to perform repair\n\n\\> Boat is then repaired once using repair kit from cargo\n\n\\> Crew member is unassigned\n\nThis means that performing a second repair requires the process to be repeated fully.\n\n  \nMy suggestion is:\n\n1. Go to sailing tab\n\n2. Click Assign next to Repairs\n\n3. Select crew member to perform repair\n\n\\> Turn the hammer icon into a button\n\n4. Click on hammer button\n\n\\> Boat is then repaired once using a repair kit from cargo\n\nThis would mean that further repairs will only require the hammer to be clicked rather than going through the whole process of assigning a crew member to repair every time.\n\n[Repair Proposal](https://preview.redd.it/ciiczc2cig3g1.png?width=284&format=png&auto=webp&s=2403bcdb7bcd4ebcd257bbd79ef21d02eca3beab)\n\n  \n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1p6mcs4/sailing_ui_improvements/","permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/1p6mcs4/sailing_ui_improvements/","score":18,"num_comments":7,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764099920.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Suggestion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/nroU89Ems9a2DgvP0Nki0f_iK8WkXSa8ITv8p8aRu5k.jpg"}

{"id":"1p6957b","name":"t3_1p6957b","subreddit":"2007scape","author":"RampantHedgehog","title":"My Deep Sea Trawling Experience","selftext":"First off, **love the activity**. It gives you a very unique and interactive way to catch fish and rewards you for focusing and learning how your specific shoal tends to behave. Carry 5-10 decent repair kits, fill your storage with fish offcuts and fish crates, gather a crew to operate your stations, and you're good to go. I wanted to share my experience here since I saw a previous post highlighting some decent fish-caught rates - it's worth also highlighting a not-so-impressive haul too.\n\n**Here are some numbers:**\n\nTime spent: 1 hour\n\nShoal type: Mostly Marlin\n\nFishing level: 93\n\nSailing level: 84\n\nSailing Exp per hour: 42k\n\nFishing Exp per hour: 19k\n\nMarlin Collected: 227\n\nBluefin Collected (secondary fish): 52\n\nFine offcuts used: 77\n\n**Relevant Stations/Ship Parts:**\n\n2x Cotton Trawling Nets, Chum Spreader, Crystal Extractor, Camphor Hull, Ironwood Mast & Cotton Sails\n\n**The good:**\n\nWhat seems good to me are the fish collection rates. I didn't track the shoal perfectly, especially in the first 10 minutes as I was busy marking tiles for myself. The fish, if sold at current prices, would fetch me about 2M, which for a fishing activity is quite good.\n\nOnce you spend some time following your shoal of choice, you'll learn where it tends to park itself, and which direction it goes afterwards. You'll eventually feel pretty comfortable doing this activity.\n\nIf your crystal extractor is right next to your net, you can hit your crystal without pausing your fishing activity. You really won't get below 30k sailing exp/hr with this station in the right spot. It's unclear if this was intended or not, but I will say the net operation animation doesn't resume properly, despite the boat telling me I am still operating my net.\n\n**The bad:**\n\nThe exp. Sorry to be one of those guys, but if I can AFK for 100k/hr at my sailing level with salvaging, I would hope that this would yield a bit more exp in general. Given the crystal exists, it's hard to ask for a lot more sailing exp, but the fishing exp should be a bit higher IMO.\n\nNotifications for shoal depth changes are not shared with you if you fall a bit behind the shoal, so you may come to the next stopping point only to lose out on half the potential fish because you couldn't possibly know what depth it swam to. **Exp drops should be indicative of correct net depth. Currently sailing exp drops are constant, even if your nets are at the wrong level.**\n\nYou need a second boat to really trawl for fish. Mostly everyone has a salvage boat, but not a trawling boat, and since you can't move stations around easily, this is a cost barrier for many players. Marlin shoals (I can't speak on lower level shoals) move quickly, so you can't really cheap-out on your sails and hull if you want to do this effectively.\n\nThis feels like a bug to me, but sometimes if a crewmember is manning the helm and you use your stored wind boost, nothing happens beyond getting a bit of exp. No speed-boost occurs. This makes keeping up with the shoal harder at times, costing me on my rates.\n\n**Let me know if you've learned any tips or tricks to get better results!**","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/1p6957b/my_deep_sea_trawling_experience/","permalink":"/r/2007scape/comments/1p6957b/my_deep_sea_trawling_experience/","score":16,"num_comments":7,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764066770.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
