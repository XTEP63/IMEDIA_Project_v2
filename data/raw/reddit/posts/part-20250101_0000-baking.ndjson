I am looking for advice on how to thicken or maybe even change the texture entirely of the berry puree so it's more solidified and cleaner to cut? \n\nI'm also not opposed to changing the vanilla pudding in the middle either for the same reasons. \n\nOur goal is to bake this into sheet pans then layer and cut from there. Toast the meringue on site. \n\nI am open to all and any feedback for the entire cake.

I have some really tough health stuff going on at the moment, so I've been trying to nail down a way to make a general purpose loaf in a way that I can manage. I've tweaked my flour blend, sugar and oil content, and my baking time and temperature, all in an attempt to get it right. I mix my flour, oil, water, 1tsp of sugar and 10g of salt in a ziploc bag, then bloom my yeast in a bowl with a little water and 1 more tsp of sugar. Then add the bubbly mixture to the bag, and knead that for 10 minutes or so. I then let it sit out at room temperature until the bag gets poofy with CO2, release the CO2, give it another mix, and refrigerate it overnight. I do this because it's easier for me if I can do a lot of the initial steps sitting down, and doing it the night before is more convenient. I was also hoping it would benefit the flavour. The next day, I tip the very poofy dough out onto a floured surface, and knead until it's as good as I can get it, put it in a tin, leave to rise a second time, dust, score, and then bake, with an oven dish of hot water in the bottom of the oven. My question is, does all of this sound good? Should I look at adding so called \"dough enhancers\"? And does a very \"enthusiastic\" second rise indicate I'm getting closer to hitting the \"sweet spot\"?
