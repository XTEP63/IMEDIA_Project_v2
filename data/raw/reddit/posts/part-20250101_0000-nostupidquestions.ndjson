{"id":"1p6k7qf","name":"t3_1p6k7qf","subreddit":"NoStupidQuestions","author":"magicmushroomsxo","title":"How do I relearn all the things I was taught in school but have forgotten?","selftext":"**Too long, didn’t feel like reading:** Ultimately, I’ve been feeling pretttty stupid lately and I’m struggling, so that’s why I’m posting this here. I have so many questions about things I feel I should know / understand at this point, that I’ve forgotten from elementary — high school, and I don’t know how to retrain my brain to get them back, or relearn them so they actually stick. Are there any apps, classes, or methods, neuro-divergent friendly, you’d recommend to relearn this information and better retain it? Vocab apps? As age will do, my brain seems to be getting blurrier as time passes and at the rate it’s happening, I’m concerned. I feel if I’m alive in 5 years, I’ll have forgotten everything I’ve learned in basic schooling.\n\n**More context:**\n\nThis is a sensitive subject for me. I can’t recall basic math, science I feel I should have a better grasp on, English, history. Things that feel they should be basic, or that people in my age range generally keep. Things I feel should be in my brain’s history, somewhere. Books, movies, tv shows that I go through the entire duration of within the last few years, I don’t remember many specifics. \n\nI’m in my early 30s, I have, for years, been diagnosed and treated for borderline personality disorder (please don’t jump to criticizing / judging patients with BPD here. There’s a lot of that on Reddit and it’s both hurtful and unhelpful), bipolar 2, ADHD, complex PTSD, and generalized anxiety. Most of this year, I spent in intensive treatment for mental health, residential, PHP & IOP and much of it feels like a blur already. Specific coping skills, mental health education… though the hope was with the repetition in my groups, I could actually retain what I learned, so much of it I can’t recall. This may be severe dissociation in response to what I’ve experienced this year, and it makes sense that various childhood memories have been blocked out, but beyond trauma, generally speaking, I feel I’m losing my memory increasingly fast. I’m not sure if there’s a correlation between the two or something is wrong with me, otherwise. I feel so stupid.\n\nI can write a text message, an email, THIS question for several minutes, rearrange the wording again and again, the sentence structure trying to remember words I’ve forgotten or how to form the way a proper sentence should be written… and how to say things I feel I once had a better grasp on. A great deal could stem from my ADHD, but if it is, it feels like it’s affecting my life more as I get older, which is concerning. Surface level, I may seem intelligent enough, but I have no idea how to learn new things and get them to stick, or relearn things I once knew and have slipped from mind. I worry if I’m alive in another 5 years, I’ll have forgotten everything I once knew. There are some things I remember in life pristinely, down to the smell in a moment — some good, some bad. There are memories that are stamped in my brain, so I know I have the ABILITY to retain information, but basic information I feel I should have, is slipping.\n\nI forget words and their meanings frequently, I can’t seem to expand my vocabulary… it kind of feels like it’s peaked where it’s at, or contrarily, it’s shrinking. I’m a good conversationalist, generally speaking. I can hold an engaging conversation, but “what’s that word?” “I can’t remember the word that means ___” “what am I thinking?” A lot of the “uhhh”s and pauses come up in most of my conversations, or I mix words up. I will look up words that I don’t know, but cannot get them to stick. I’m passionate about my morals and beliefs, but I feel too dumb to debate them — tripping on words, unable to access the data in my brain to back them up. I’ve lost facts. I can type out the words more powerfully than I can speak them… because I have significantly longer to process words. Sometimes it feels like I’m becoming less fluent in the English language, though it’s my first and sole language. These are *ALL* undoubtedly, more advanced than some things I’ve gotten stuck on, but I’ve forgotten basic biology — what elec/pro/neutrons are, molecules and atoms, and figures of speech (a term I had to look up) like aphorism, hyperbole and preposition, congress procedures — bills becoming laws, etc. Many of these examples I’ve recently tried to research and have already left my mind. Looking over this last paragraph, it feels like I should give myself a break to an extent, but… it’s so much deeper than science, congress, and vocab. I just can’t come up with the examples right now. Comparison may be the thief of joy, but I have a friend that processes things much more quickly than I do; whenever I hang out with her group of friends — other 30-somethings, I feel like an outcast in their group circle. The idiot she invited along that isn’t quite up to speed. \n\nI want to read more, but processing literature that’s beyond a middle school reading level — reading at all, has become really, difficult for me, which feels humiliating. I want to process what I’m reading, so if it ever comes up in conversation I can explain it. I don’t know where to start. have a difficult time staying engaged long enough to read anything from a legal document, to something I’d enjoy. I have asked a friend to read my lease and explain it to me the last couple of times I’ve renewed because I’ll reread the same sentence a few times before I can keep it,  if I do at all, and it’s getting harder. \n\nI’m expected to be an “adult” at this point, but feel so far from it. I go to therapy 3 times a week for my mental health, but I don’t have someone to help me with everything else I’ve fallen behind on. \n\nHow do I catch up?\n \n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1p6k7qf/how_do_i_relearn_all_the_things_i_was_taught_in/","permalink":"/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1p6k7qf/how_do_i_relearn_all_the_things_i_was_taught_in/","score":5,"num_comments":7,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764095220.0,"edited":1764098142.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
