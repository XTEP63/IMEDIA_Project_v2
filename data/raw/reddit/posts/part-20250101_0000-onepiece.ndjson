However, Oda did a really good job painting how much of a challenge it would be for Luffy to accomplish his dream. I don’t know about everyone else, but there definitely was a moment that clicked, and I started to believe with him in what he was saying. It no longer became just a shonen gag of the MC constantly repeating their dream; it started to sound like an affirmation of why we should believe Luffy when he says he’ll do it. It’s hard to explain — it’s like he isn’t trying to get himself to believe he can do it; he’s trying to get all of us to.

I’m actually far more fond of him now. Don’t get me wrong, he’s one of my favorite characters outside of Luffy, Kuzan & Usopp. (There are more but I am keeping my eye on these specific characters throughout the story) \n\nIt also finally makes sense (to me) why every single one of his pupils (excluding Colby) decided to go rouge in their chase for life & justice. Garp teaches the fundamentals of being a decent human being and a loving person. Can it be an ignorant lesson at times? Absolutely, but his passion for peace and standing up for true justice cannot be ignored. \n\nMy two questions are  .. why doesn’t he become a pirate or revolutionary? He claims to protect the rank and file but I feel like there’s more to that .. he’s protecting the concept of true justice. He probably doesn’t want to fight Imu again either. I don’t blame him. Two, can we expect him to join the straw hats in these last moments? \n\nHe might already be dead .. but it’s always fun to speculate. Thanks for reading!

Now hear this. Pluton, the only weapon that we know has fallen into the hands of HUMANITY. Franky had the blueprints, and his master had them. You might be thinking, “that’s not true, imu has one!” As far as we know, imu and the gorosei might as well not even be humans at this point. Maybe more like…gods. And what happened in Greek mythology? The Greek titan, Prometheus, (who we’ve already seen in the series as a flaming fireball) stole the fire from the gods, and bestowed it among humanity. My theory, is that in place of Prometheus, in one piece it is queen nefertiti D Lilly. She took the ponoglyphs, possibly containing the knowledge of pluton, from the world government and possibly imu (the gods) and bestowed them among the world. (Humanity) this would explain why pluton (the replacement for fire) would be the only ancient weapon that the world has the blueprints and access too. And when all 3 ancient weapons come back, just like in the mythology, Uranus (god of the sky) Posideon (god of the sea) And pluton, (fire) all represent the 3 barriers that every planet has. Water, Earth, Fire, Sky. You might be thinking, where does earth come from? My theory is that the humans represent the earth so when a human uses the weapon (or maybe even possibly a devil fruit user) With all 4 elements together, it would take an incredible strong person to wield and use the weapon. My theory is this person will be Luffy. Connecting the oceans. Because the red line and/or anything else could be destroyed with  ease with all 3 ancient weapons together, bringing about a new dawn, a new age, and putting the planet back into continent, one ocean, in one piece.

{"id":"1p6b90r","name":"t3_1p6b90r","subreddit":"OnePiece","author":"hellosalesjunkie","title":"Guessing Imu’s Powers (including Domi Reversi)","selftext":"*Updated: Added #10 (Shapeshifting) + #11 Why BB wanted the Yami-Yami Fruit.*  \n  \nWe can all see Imu’s powers are inspired by the Devil’s power.\n\nSo I’ll keep it simple and link everything to old cultural narratives about the Devil and the price that comes with their power.\n\n**1. Devil = Earth God**\n\nI think Imu has one of the God Mythical Zoans… The Earth God.\n\nBut his powers are inspired by powers of the devil.\n\nIn Christian scripture, the Devil is given titles that assign him a form of dominion over the earthly, material realm like \"God of This World\" or \"Ruler of This World\".\n\nSince Devil Fruits, especially God Mythical Zoans like Nika, come from human desires or will as explained by Vegapunk. Mu’s devil fruit must have been born from dark human desires.\n\n**2. The Devil’s Power = Cost**\n\nThe biggest rule for Devil power in myths is that you get awesome power, but you always trade something huge.\n\nSo there’s likely a tradeoff to using the devil’s powers. It probably costs Imu and their followers stuff like their life force, sanity, or the need for constant sacrifice (like slaves!).\n\n**3. Immortality**\n\nImu probably has the Ope-Ope no Mi's Eternal Youth Surgery. But I think the Five Elders and the God's Knights do not.\n\nI doubt they got the Ope-Ope surgery themselves.\n\nThink about it. If you're a supreme power-hungry ruler like Imu, why would you let your subordinates have the exact same \"never-dying\" advantage as you?\n\nThat just risks your own power right? Having truly immortal allies is dangerous.\n\nMy theory is that the Elders and God's Knights get their \"immortality\" directly from Imu. It’s likely almost a twisted version of Basil Hawkins’ power. They’re probably sacrificing Imu’s life force (which is infinite thanks to the youth surgery) OR their slaves.\n\nSo every time an Elder or GK is wounded or killed, the damage is instantly transferred to a different person… like their slaves. They regenerate instantly but that other person drops dead.\n\nThis perfectly explains why advanced Haki is able to damage them. Their defense isn't true invulnerability. It's just a Devil Fruit power that redirects the damage. Haki can disrupt that power and finally hit them directly.\n\nThis also explains their loyalty to Imu. If Imu is the source of the power and can easily take their immortality away, of course they follow every command.\n\nMaybe that’s how Imu \"killed\" Saturn. Imu just revoked his immortality and Saturn instantly died of old age (since he's likely ancient).\n\nAnd this brings me to Figarland Garling. I'm guessing he used to have this immortality from Imu but was punished for the God Valley incident.\n\nThat's why he's the only one who looks visibly aged among the Elders and the God's Knights. He probably only got his immortality back recently.\n\n**4. Domi Reversi**\n\nIf you Google \"Domi Reversi\" it translates to something like \"returning to the origin.\"\n\nWe've only seen Imu use this power on groups like the Davy Clan and the Giants so far. That makes me wonder if \"Domi Reversi\" is like a Tribal Contract with the Devil (aka Imu).\n\nThis power might only work on ancient clans that have been around forever (like the Giants) who were forced into a pact or \"Tribal Contract\" with Imu in the past.\n\nThink about ancient times when one kingdom conquered another. The defeated tribes or clans had to make a choice… serve the new ruler or they all die. They probably agreed to serve. Imu, being the ultimate ruler, sealed that a binding \"devil's contract.\"\n\nNow anyone carrying the gene/bloodline of that specific conquered tribe can then be instantly called upon or controlled by Imu using \"Domi Reversi.\"\n\nTho the transformations seem temporary since we haven’t seen anyone stay in that state in a long period.\n\n**5. “The Abyss” Teleportation**\n\nThe Elders and GK often call their teleportation “the abyss”.\n\nAnd again, if you search online, it’s connected to how “The Devil” in different cultures travel through time and space.\n\nIf we follow the myths, the Abyss is not a stable highway. It’s like the Devil's power connects Hell/Mariejoa to the world with a temporary stretched rope.\n\nHaki Can Break the Rope as we’ve seen in Egghead. When the giant robot used a burst of Joyboy's reserved Haki it immediately disrupted the Abyss power and forced the Elders to teleport back to Mariejoa except for Saturn who was there physically.\n\nSo it might be a spiritual way to travel not a physical one.\n\n**6. Imu's Mind Control**\n\nThe Devil's power in myths is often to take over someone's mind and will.\n\nWhen the Elders and Knights use Imu’s power, the trade-off is the loss of their own free will.\n\nThey act like powerful puppets following Imu's commands.\n\nThis is like a devil’s spiritual possession. They are constantly hearing Imu's commands in their minds turning them into perfectly loyal tools.\n\n**7. The Devil’s Contract**\n\nThe entire framework of Imu's control, from the Elders' powers to the use of \"Domi Reversi,\" seems to function as a classic Devil's Contract.\n\nIt's a bargain where power is exchanged for a heavy price in exchange for power and Imu’s control.\n\nFor those receiving the power the trade-off is their freedom and life ownership. Complete opposite of Nika’s purpose (freedom and liberation).\n\n**8. Imu’s fruit taking over**\n\nVegapunk taught us that awakened Zoan Fruits have the strongest influence on a user's mind, sometimes completely taking over their personality.\n\nI think Imu is a victim of their own Devil Fruit.\n\nImu might have been a decent person 800 years ago, perhaps just eating the Mythical Zoan to save their kingdom.\n\nBut as Vegapunk warned these Fruits have their own will.\n\nThe Fruit slowly corrupted Imu. Trading Imu's original personality for the immense power to rule the world.\n\nNow Imu isn't really Imu anymore.\n\nThey've become a puppet for the Devil Fruit's ancient will simply carrying out its dark agenda.\n\n**9. Imu’s Opposite**\n\nIf Imu is the Devil, Luffy is the Anti-Devil.\n\nImu's power is all about Rules, Contracts, and Control.\n\nThe Nika Fruit brings Laughter and Freedom.\n\nThe sound of the Drums of Liberation is a spiritual attack against Imu's joyless power.\n\nThe Devil is the Master of Lies. The Poneglyphs are the ultimate weapon because they expose the World Government's lies and reveal the truth Imu tried to erase (the Void Century).\n\n  \n**10. Shapeshifting Devil**\n\nIn most myths the Devil is a master shapeshifter. So like Nika, Imu can control their size and appearance, hiding their true identity or taking terrifying forms in battle.  \n\n\n**11. Blackbeard’s Counter - Yami-Yami Fruit**\n\nThis explains why Blackbeard waited a lifetime for the Yami-Yami no Mi since it can nullify the powers of other Devil Fruits. BB wants the one power that can cancel out all of Imu's powers.\n\nIt could cancel the Elders' redirected immortality. It could cancel the effects of \"Domi Reversi\" on his allies (if the contracted clan guess is true). Tho I doubt he’ll have the haki to cancel Imu’s DF abilities in person.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/1p6b90r/guessing_imus_powers_including_domi_reversi/","permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/1p6b90r/guessing_imus_powers_including_domi_reversi/","score":7,"num_comments":9,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764073917.0,"edited":1764100456.0,"link_flair_text":"Theory","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

{"id":"1p67y21","name":"t3_1p67y21","subreddit":"OnePiece","author":"blueontheradio","title":"Kuma's Character Analysis [The Best Man]","selftext":"1. A Good Man is Kind, Humble, and Cares for the Vulnerable\n\nKuma has always been genuinely kind. Even as a child, he treated everyone with respect and looked after people who were struggling. He constantly put others before himself, often going out of his way to help people who had no connection to him. This is most clearly shown when he becomes a pastor and devotes himself to caring for the poor and elderly in his village.\n\n2. A Good Man is Honourable and Loyal\n\nLoyalty is one of the most valued traits in One Piece, and Kuma embodies it completely. He always looks out for the people in his village and stays devoted to those he cares about. His reliability is shown even more by the trust he earns from Monkey D. Dragon, a man who rarely lets anyone close. Kuma is someone others can depend on.\n\n3. A Good Man Endeavours To Listen To, Care For, and Respect Women\n\nWomen play an important role in Kuma’s life, and he treats them with genuine respect. He shows love and care toward Bonney and Ginny, accepts guidance from Conney, and supports Betty as she takes on a leadership role in the Revolutionary Army. Kuma understands the value of the women around him and knows he wouldn’t be who he is without them.\n\n4. A Good Man Loves and Cares for His Children\n\nKuma’s story shows what true fatherhood looks like. In a world where many Shonen fathers are distant or harmful, Kuma stands out completely. When he finds newborn Bonney beside her mother’s body, he immediately chooses to raise her as his own. From that moment on, we see him devote himself to her with patience, gentleness, and love.\n\nHe learns how to care for her from the village elders, comforts her when she feels insecure, encourages her curiosity, spends quality time with her, and constantly shows affection. Even when she becomes sick, he travels the world to find a cure and is willing to sacrifice everything for her.\n\n5. A Good Man is Selfless\n\nKuma is selflessness in its purest form. Throughout his story, he repeatedly puts the needs of others before his own. He gives Ginny his food even when he needs it more, and he uses his power to absorb the pain of the sick and elderly. His biggest sacrifices show this even more clearly: giving up his free will to save Bonney, and later spending two years protecting the Straw Hats’ ship while enduring endless attacks.\n\n6. A Good Man is Clever, Studious and Culturally-Curious\n\nDespite his gentle, naïve appearance, Kuma is clearly intelligent and curious. As he travels the world, he takes time to learn about different cultures and writes thoughtful letters to Bonney describing what he discovers. He also shows sharp planning and quick thinking and balancing obedience to the government while secretly resisting them. Even as a child, always reading and learning, it’s clear Kuma has a bright and thoughtful mind.\n\n7. A Good Man is Emotionally Open\n\nKuma feels deeply and isn’t afraid to show it. He cries from happiness, sadness, pain, gratitude, and pride especially when it comes to Bonney. He expresses these emotions openly around the people he trusts, without shame or hesitation, and this sincerity is a huge part of why he is so loved. What makes this even more powerful is his past. As a child born into slavery, Kuma was punished for crying and even forced by his father to fake joy in the face of abuse. Despite that trauma, he grows into an adult who allows himself to feel openly and teaches his daughter to do the same. It’s incredibly heart-warming and shows just how far he has come.\n\n8. A Good Man Learns the Importance of Saying “I Love You”\n\nOne of the saddest moments in Kuma’s story is losing Ginny. His fear and low self-worth kept him from telling her how he truly felt, and in his rush to reach her, he even misses her final words: “I love you. Always have, always will.”\n\nThat’s why it means so much that, after her death, Kuma never holds back when expressing love to Bonney. He tells her he loves her constantly through his words, his actions, his praise, and the letters he writes when he’s away. Unlike many male characters who express love only through sacrifice or indirect gestures, Kuma makes sure Bonney hears it clearly and often. He wants her to grow up with no doubts about how deeply she is loved.\n\n9. A Good Man Is Gentle But Uses His Strength When Necessary\n\nKuma’s immense strength born from his Buccaneer heritage and amplified by his powerful Devil Fruit is one of the reasons he was enslaved, yet it’s also one of his greatest gifts. He’s physically formidable and feared across the world, capable of defeating entire crews with ease.\n\nBut despite all that, Kuma is a true pacifist at heart. He speaks softly, treats others gently, and dislikes violence. Unlike fighters such as Luffy or Zoro, who enjoy a good battle now and then, Kuma fights only when he must. He has the power to destroy, but he chooses kindness first using his strength only when the situation demands it.\n\n10. A Good Man Is a Revolutionary (Who Hates Fascists and Inequality)\n\nKuma may be gentle and selfless, but he has never accepted injustice. He openly admires the Revolutionary Army, a group that encourages oppressed people to rise up against their authoritarian rulers and challenge the corrupt elite. Even as a child, Kuma stood up to a Celestial Dragon and rejected the inequality they represented. His kindness doesn’t make him passive he fights for a world where that kindness can actually matter.\n\n11. A Good Man Has Faith\n\nKuma’s faith is shown more through actions than words. As a pastor, he helps the poor, tends to the sick, and builds a sense of community. His belief isn’t about preaching it’s about caring for people and taking responsibility for their well-being, even when it costs him.\n\nHe believes in Nika, the sun god of freedom, laughter, and liberation a source of hope for oppressed people. This faith helps Kuma see beyond his own life and focus on the future. It’s what inspires him to invest so deeply in Bonney and Luffy, trusting that they will help bring freedom to the world.\n\n12. A Good Man Believes That Everything Has Purpose\n\nThere’s one more aspect of Kuma that often goes unnoticed, and it ties directly into his faith: the idea that all things work together for good. Kuma lived a life filled with pain, loss, and hardship so much that it might seem cruel or meaningless. Why should one person have to endure so much? The truth is that Kuma endured because he could. Every moment of suffering shaped him into the person the world needed. His journey across the globe searching for a cure for Bonney gave him the knowledge and experience he needed to send each Straw Hat to exactly the right place. Without Kuma, Luffy would not become Nika, the Straw Hats wouldn’t survive Sabaody, and they would never reach the New World. Nothing in Kuma’s life was wasted; every struggle prepared him for the role he would one day play.\n\nKuma’s story shows the quiet power of endurance. He kept going, he kept believing, and he kept giving everything he had. And when he finally reached the end, he could rest with a smile, knowing he had poured out everything for the sake of others. Whether he fully understood it or simply trusted in it, his faith that all things would eventually work together for good proved true and the world of One Piece is better because of it.\n\n13. A Good Man is Flawed (But He Apologises & Listens to Criticism)\n\nKuma is a remarkable man, but he is not without flaws and that’s part of what makes him so human. His biggest struggles come from his lack of self-love. Growing up as a slave, treated as property and conditioned to endure endless suffering, Kuma learned early on to think very little of himself. He became overly self-critical, quick to accept mistreatment, and convinced that his own needs didn’t matter. This deep-rooted belief that he was unworthy of love is what kept him from giving Ginny the affirmation she longed for, even though he loved her deeply.\n\nThroughout their relationship, Ginny tries to guide him toward self-compassion. She tells him when he’s being too hard on himself, worries when he literally absorbs the pain of others, and steps in when people try to exploit his kindness. In the end, her last request is simple: stay by her side and listen to her final words rather than rushing off to fix the unfixable. But Kuma’s instinct to sacrifice himself overrides everything, and he misses her farewell a tragedy shaped by his belief that he must carry every burden alone.\n\nKuma embodies the idea that “compassion without boundaries is self-harm.” His refusal to prioritize himself causes pain not only for him but for those he loves. It leads him to hide the truth from Bonney, pushing her into danger to find him. It pushes him into a desperate deal with the World Government, allowing them to use him, and his clones, to further their own oppressive rule. His martyrdom, noble as it is, ends up creating suffering he never intended.\n\nYet these flaws do not make Kuma any less admirable they make him more compelling. His toxic positivity, his silence about his own needs, and his instinct to endure alone are tragic, but also deeply human. We love Kuma not because he is perfect, but because he tries so hard despite his imperfections. His mistakes don’t diminish him; they give him depth and remind us that goodness is often messy, complicated, and painful. So what does it mean that Oda while presenting Kuma as one of the best men in the series also subjects him to some of the most heartbreaking suffering in One Piece?\n\nThere are several possible readings. Perhaps it highlights the cruelty of the world under the Celestial Dragons, a world where even the kindest souls can be crushed under authoritarian power. Maybe it shows that self-sacrifice, while noble, is often unrewarded, unrecognized, and sometimes even harmful. Or perhaps it’s meant to illustrate that true goodness isn’t defined by ease, but by resilience by continuing to care even when the world is unforgiving.\n\nMy interpretation is simpler: Kuma’s story teaches that being a good man someone who loves, cries, protects the vulnerable, and believes in freedom won’t always bring reward in a broken world. But good men don’t act for reward. They make the world better simply by existing in it, by choosing love over cruelty and hope over despair. Even if they never see the results, their goodness ripples outward.\n\nThat’s why revolutionaries become revolutionaries, and why pirates chase freedom. Maybe Oda wants us to find a balance to be kind and selfless like Kuma, but also to value ourselves enough to pursue our own dreams, so long as they don’t harm others. Kuma shows us what goodness looks like, flaws and all  and why the world needs it now more than ever.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/1p67y21/kumas_character_analysis_the_best_man/","permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/1p67y21/kumas_character_analysis_the_best_man/","score":7,"num_comments":0,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764062136.0,"edited":1764062420.0,"link_flair_text":"Analysis","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Its power comes from humility, freedom and the bonds it creates.\n\nIn a world of thrones, tyrants and families \"destined\" to rule, Luffy smashes everything with a crown made of the most human material possible.\nIt is as if he were saying: “I do not reign, but I nourish the freedom of others.”\n\nAnd in my opinion it is one of the most powerful symbolisms of the work.\n\nWhat do you think?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/1p6tekw/luffys_straw_hat_as_the_antithesis_to_the_golden/","permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/1p6tekw/luffys_straw_hat_as_the_antithesis_to_the_golden/","score":3,"num_comments":11,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764116884.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Theory","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Knowing what works, Japanese or otherwise have influenced Oda. \n\n2. What stories or cultural artifacts does he enjoy references. \n\n3. Mapping the general narrative the story is trying to make. \n\n4. Knowing Japanese cultural story telling and cliches. \n\nJust gonna throw out some theories based on commonly used literary tropes, themes, references, and cliches. \n\nThe man with burn scars whose black ship sinks any ship that gets near it? Yeah, that has to a reference to Jules Vernes 10,000 leagues under the sea. Captain Nemo’s submarine also causes ships to disappear and its method of appearing and diving fits the bil. Captain Nemo would also make sense as a one piece character. \n\nThis could tie in with the ancient kingdom and the fact that the true one piece world is submerged. If there is a big submarine it could be used to show the crew the submerged world and serve to move them to the one piece.   \n\nSpeaking of the submerged world… the ancient could have survived. They already did Atlantis with fish-man island but they could do it again with the final island. \n\nImu is probably using Magic and Haki. It’s been shown already that Haki can be put into objects in egghead, so there’s no reason to think it can’t be placed into people. It would also explain why you need a weird Haki resonance to undue to the god knights immortality. \n\nIt’s likely Imu placed some of their Haki within their favorite subjects, allowing them to be immortal but also allowing Imu to assume control. Additionally it’s probably Magic or just the corrupting force of his will that transforms the elders into demons, not devil fruits. \n\nThe ancient kingdom was probably Atlantis, maybe even ruled by Space Aliens (Seen in the cover stories seemingly extracting resources from the moon). Imu and the elders were either kings or the elders were his original knights. \n\nIn a shocking twist, maybe Imu stole power from the ancient kingdom(for mankind) and gave it to his followers through Haki and devil fruits. By stealing power, it probably doomed the world and led to the massive flood. This would make Imu a dark shadow to Luffy and a twisted Prometheus type character.

Without her, the system shows its nature: conflict, domination, clash. The world as we know it is built on war, and the “D” serves to remind us of this.\n\nGOLD → GOL (GOAL)\nRemove the D, gold becomes \"goal\", \"goal\", that is, the objective.\nThe wealth fades and only the race for the goal remains, to the point of scoring. The D is the difference between a treasure and the illusion of the finish line.\n\nDEVIL → EVIL\nAnd this is the most powerful.\nTake away the D from the “devil” and what remains is simply EVIL, pure evil.\nThe D here functions as a linguistic mask: you remove it and what the devil represents remains without filters. Bad in its essential state.\nIt is as if the \"D\" was always what keeps in balance, what \"covers\", what allows the word to present itself in one way, while the truth is one step below.\n\nSo my theory is this:\nthe “D” does not only indicate a lost family or people.\nThe “D” is the symbol of those who remove the mask from words, of those who dismantle the given meanings, of those who can see what is really behind language and behind the order of the world.\n\nThe bearers of the D are the ones who collapse the official narratives.\nWho remove the letter and look inside.\n\nWhat do you think?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/1p6tjgc/the_d_theory_in_one_piece_the_letter_that_unmasks/","permalink":"/r/OnePiece/comments/1p6tjgc/the_d_theory_in_one_piece_the_letter_that_unmasks/","score":1,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764117249.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Theory","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
