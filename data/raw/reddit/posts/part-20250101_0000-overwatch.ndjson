And if I could say one single thing or give one tip that ive noticed helps when it comes to climbing is PLAY YOUR LIFE. \n\nwhat I mean by that is the less you die the better. obviously don’t sit in a corner for the entire game. but if you’re ever thinking of making a play and there’s a high chance you’re going to die DONT DO IT. \n\nby staying alive and not feeding you help out your team in multiple ways . 1) your presence. The enemy team has to account for you and respect that you are there. 2) your supports, if you aren’t a support already, don’t have to waste resources to keep you from dying. \n\n  \nso tldr; dont feed is the best advice to climb imo","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1p6od3b/my_maybe_wanted_2_cents/","permalink":"/r/Overwatch/comments/1p6od3b/my_maybe_wanted_2_cents/","score":0,"num_comments":6,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764104441.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"News & Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I keep hearing people say that you will get stuck in low/mid ranks if all you do is healbot and you need to focus a lot more on dealing damage if you want to climb. I don’t really care about climbing in this game all that much but I would like some insight because to me when I play Bap and Ana I always feel like there is zero downtime for heals like there is always someone who is not full hp or about to take damage while shooting at the enemies feels pretty useless unless an enemy is out of position that I can quickly kill and go back to healing (I also struggle with tunnel visioning on kills a lot like I dont want to just poke them and move on unless I’m just throwing an anti at their tank I want to kill them or at least get them to 1hp and semi take them out of the fight before I go back to healing) I mostly have this dilemma with Bap and Ana not Illari or Moira who I also sometimes play. \n\nI always have most healing in the game on Bap but I still lose ~50% of games now that I hit plat 1-plat 2, do I need to just try and get used to the shoot, heal, shoot, heal play style on Bap even if I’m just hitting a tank that’s being pocketed?
