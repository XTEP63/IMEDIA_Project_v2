{"id":"1p6r78z","name":"t3_1p6r78z","subreddit":"nfl","author":"MasonL52","title":"Disaster Class: Pete Carroll and the Raiders","selftext":"**Pete Carroll and John Spytek’s Year-1 Disaster Class**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Ashton Jeanty** will be a fantastic player for a long time, as have Josh Jacobs and Saquon Barkley have been. In 11 total seasons with the teams that drafted them, the two won one playoff game between them. Barkley, specifically, has served as a clear example of why to bypass the shiny and exciting slam-dunk pick at RB early in a rebuild. \n\nThese expectations were directly a result of Pete Carroll (and possibly Tom Brady). From day one, he maintained that the Raiders were going to compete, not rebuild. That confidence (or arrogance) led to drafting a RB at 6th overall, and trading a 3rd-round pick for a 34-year-old QB due to an extension. \n\nInstead, the Raiders are no better. They sit at 2-9 going into December, on pace to finish worse than any of Josh McDaniels or Antonio Pierce’s teams. In fact, the Raiders haven’t finished with three wins or fewer since 2014 with Dennis Allen and Tony Sparano. \n\nIf you care for the content and want to help with a little support, [I write more team building content on my Substack](https://guidetoteambuilding.substack.com/p/pete-carroll-and-the-raiders-year) :)\n\nAlso last week I wrote on Kyler Murray's potential landing spots this off-season, which included the Raiders. Check that out below!\n\n[<- Kyler Murray Landing Spots](https://old.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1p1ltkd/ranking_kyler_murrays_most_likely_2026_spots/)\n\n&nbsp; \n\n###It’s Easy to Say in Hindsight\n\nThe fact of the matter is that **Ben Johnson** turned down this job. Whatever reason he had, the Raiders were not in a position to grab one of the hot new HC candidates this cycle. Pete Carroll was universally seen as a pretty good option, capable of running a team and at least bringing them to competence. \n\nHiring **Chip Kelly** was far more bold, but still a savvy move. Having made his way through the college ranks since he was last in the NFL, he did appear to be a good option with an innovative offense and former NFL experience. \n\n**Geno Smith** was certainly seen as a great move, and it was the Seahawks that appeared to be the losers by moving on from a proven commodity for a younger, but more volatile Sam Darnold. Smith washing up this quickly wasn’t expected, but seeing his declining play over the previous two seasons from his breakout campaign probably should have been a sign. \n\nIt’s impressive how badly all of their prominent signings aged, but I don’t think it was incompetence to make any such hire. That being said, every other decision… \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###There’s no excuse for how the Raiders built their 2025 team\n\nThe 2024 Raiders had a few major issues. \n\nIn 2024, the offensive line finished 27th in PFSN’s OL Impact (67.7 grade). They weren’t great in pass protection, but were awful at run blocking. \n\nThey returned all five starters from the end of last season. They hired Pete Carroll’s son, Brandon, as the OL coach. They passed on **Armand Membou** in favor of Ashton Jeanty. Through November, Membou ranks 18th of 80 tackles per PFF grade. \n\nIn fairness to them, they’ve been missing LT **Kolton Miller** since early in the season. That compounded issues further at one spot they’d otherwise be able to rely on, but he wasn’t fixing the overarching issue, either. \n\nThe Raiders did spend two 3rd-round picks on OL this past draft, but Caleb Rogers and Charles Grant have combined for just 1 snap this year. \n\n**Brock Bowers** is the true #1 target on this team, but he could desperately use a running mate. Jakobi Meyers was the only other credible threat for them last year with 1,027 yards. He’d be traded at the deadline. Tre Tucker was the only other receiver above 500 yards. Their third most productive receiver was Davante Adams in three games. Over a season, it was DJ Turner with 158 yards. \n\nThe Raiders passed on **Tetairoa McMillan**, who has 783 yards and five touchdowns through 11 games of his rookie career. He, too, is the only credible receiving threat on his team. \n\nThey would draft a pair of receivers, Jack Bech in the 2nd round and Dont’e Thornton in the 4th. Without Davante Adams and with Bowers hurt for a bulk of the season, those two have combined (through 11 games) for 35 targets, 15 receptions, 204 yards, and no touchdowns. **Tyler Lockett**, age 33, signed at midseason, has 12 catches and 139 yards in four games played for the Raiders. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n###What Do They Do Now?\n\nCarroll was to come in and turn a hapless Raiders organization into a culturally tough and competitive team. Instead, the Raiders have nothing to show for it and even fewer excuses as frustrations mount. They’ll now have to decide whether to move on from yet another coach early and bring in their 5th full-time head coach since 2021. \n\nFiring Carroll, a known program builder, after one year with a horrible roster will not be a good look. Returning Carroll may be even riskier and yet another lost season if he doesn’t turn the team around quickly. \n\nIt’s too early to get a read on what the Raiders are thinking, so we’ll wait on the coaching and turn to the roster.\n\nNeeds:\n\n- OL\n- QB\n- WR\n- DT\n- LB\n- DB\n\nThis may look like I listed everything, but the Raiders are pretty sound at Edge, RB, and TE. So, that’s something. You don’t get to 2-9 bad without having holes throughout.\n\n&nbsp; \n\n**To Quarterback or Not to QB?** The Raiders certainly need a QB, and they have just enough firepower on offense to give one a chance. That said, I’m a little skeptical about both: this QB class and the state of this offense. \n\nNow, if the Raiders brass falls in love with Dante Moore or Ty Simpson and gets the chance to draft them, then they should. Otherwise, I’d take the best OL available and call Derek Carr out of retirement. A competent OC and QB will do wonders for this offense.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Trade Maxx Crosby?**\n\nIt’s tough. Crosby has been adamant about staying in Vegas, so trading such a loyal, elite edge rusher is a brutal decision to make. When the Raiders traded Khalil Mack, they were unable to turn the assets into a Mack-level impact. \n\nThat said, Crosby is 28, playing great football, and you’re unlikely to compete within his window. He also remains one of the few building blocks that this team could turn into a strength. I don’t think there’s a wrong answer here. A few possible trade packages include:\n\n- Cowboys: Two 26’ 1sts, 28’ 3rd\n- Browns: ‘26 1st (Jacksonville) ‘26 2nd, ‘27 1st \n- Jets: ‘26 1st (Indy), ‘26 2nd, ‘26 2st (Indy) \n- Commanders: ‘26 1st (top-10), ‘27 1st\n\nTough to say no to such packages, even if that means replacing Crosby. If they do, it’s a great class at the position, so you can start with Miami’s Reuben Bain Jr, or Ohio State’s Arvell Reese.\n\nThe hole left by **Christian Wilkins** at DT remains. Another unlucky signing, but what was supposed to be a mainstay along the line has only left it empty. Clemson’s Peter Woods would be a massive get if you either build around Maxx Crosby or trade him for more picks. If replacing him outright\n\nUtah’s Spencer Fano is trending toward OT1, so doubling up with him and an edge rusher would be an enticing draft. You could also go the Bengals route as well and take my WR1 Jordyn Tyson to make an incredible trio of skill talent, but I’d only recommend that if they hire Klint Kubiak with a scheme that can hide the OL. \n\nThe Raiders will make for a very interesting case study with whatever they decide to do this offseason. They could easily blow it up again, or aggressively pursue competition sooner than later.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1p6r78z/disaster_class_pete_carroll_and_the_raiders/","permalink":"/r/nfl/comments/1p6r78z/disaster_class_pete_carroll_and_the_raiders/","score":265,"num_comments":167,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764111152.0,"edited":1764116476.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

{"id":"1p6ilxw","name":"t3_1p6ilxw","subreddit":"nfl","author":"erixville","title":"I created a mathematical power ranking calculator.","selftext":"I don't know why I cared enough to do this. I guess I wanted to see if there was a way to take more than a team's record and vibes into account when trying to figure out who's good and who's bad because this season has been weird. The formula takes the outcome of each team's game and assigns them points based on whether they won or lost, by how much, and who their opponent was. It also weighs recent games over games that took place earlier in the season so it's not skewed too much by weird early results like the Raiders beating the Patriots (sorry Raiders).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt works like this:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf a 7-3 team beats a 2-5 team by a score of 27-14, the winning team scored 27 of the 41 total points scored in the game and gets about 66% (27/41) of their opponent's wins added to their column: \n\n&nbsp;\n\n66% of 2 = +1.317 points for the winning team.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe losing team then gets about 66% of their opponent's losses removed from their column:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n66% of 3 = -1.976 points for the losing team.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe idea is if a good team beats a bad team, they don't get as many points as a good team beating another good team. And if a bad team loses to a good team, they don't lose as many points as a bad team losing to another bad team. Barely winning and/or losing also has a lower impact than winning or losing significantly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTies were weird to figure out, but I went with subtracting each tying team's loss count from their win count, and giving half of that number to their opponent so the worse team would gain more points for tying with the better team and vice versa. So if the 7-3 team and 2-5 team had tied, the team with the better record would have lost 1.5 points, and the team with the worse record would gain 2 points. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen to correct for how the team is currently performing, the impact of previous games drops by about 5.55% for each week that passes since each week is 5.55% of the season (100%/18). So with week 12 just wrapping up, the points added or lost in week 1 contributes 38.9% of the current score, week 4 contributes 55.6%, and so on.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI added a tier list based on each team's standard deviation from the average for some extra context. I didn't take into account garbage time points because it would take forever and there's no mathematical way to differentiate garbage time points from a failed comeback, which matters. It also doesn't factor in road performance vs. home performance, since as far as I can tell it wouldn't make that much of a difference. It's not perfect or particularly useful but there are some surprises that almost made this worth the time it took.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n|Rank|Score|Team|Tier|\n:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|1|24.355|LAR|S|\n|2|13.739|DEN|A|\n|3|12.686|NE|A|\n|4|10.236|HOU|A|\n|5|9.707|PHI|B|\n|6|9.542|SEA|B|\n|7|9.223|JAX|B|\n|8|7.998|SF|B|\n|9|7.644|KC|B|\n|10|6.613|CHI|B|\n|11|5.684|IND|B|\n|12|5.566|BAL|B|\n|13|5.399|GB|B|\n|14|4.705|DET|B|\n|15|2.996|BUF|B|\n|16|2.403|PIT|C|\n|17|2.058|TB|C|\n|18|1.339|LAC|C|\n|19|0.450|DAL|C|\n|20|-3.247|CAR|C|\n|21|-5.281|MIA|D|\n|22|-7.479|MIN|D|\n|23|-8.798|ATL|D|\n|24|-9.085|AZ|D|\n|25|-11.771|CIN|F|\n|26|-12.186|CLE|F|\n|27|-12.668|NO|F|\n|28|-13.188|NYG|F|\n|29|-13.368|WAS|F|\n|30|-13.627|NYJ|F|\n|31|-16.808|TEN|F|\n|32|-18.889|LV|F​|\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTL:DR the Rams are very good.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf, by some miracle, you all like this or find it interesting I'll update it after each week for the rest of the season.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1p6ilxw/i_created_a_mathematical_power_ranking_calculator/","permalink":"/r/nfl/comments/1p6ilxw/i_created_a_mathematical_power_ranking_calculator/","score":176,"num_comments":93,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764091731.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

{"id":"1p6of6l","name":"t3_1p6of6l","subreddit":"nfl","author":"NFLPowerRankers","title":"Official r/NFL Week 12 Power Rankings","selftext":"Welcome to week 12 of the 2025 [r/NFL](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL/) power rankings, the most biased-unbiased source for power rankings on the web. The Rams stand alone in week 12, with only a few rankers against the grain on the Patriots bandwagon. Beyond that, the top 10 is a mess. The Eagles, Colts, and Bills did not meet expectations, while the Lions and Chiefs won in uncomfortable fashion. With new news of Lamar and Mayfield injuries, the Bucs and Ravens are showing weakness at the wrong time, yet no teams seem to truly be capitalizing outside of a Davis Mills led Texans. Can the Cowboys continue to keep their win streak alive? Does a win against JJ McCarthy actually count? Discuss! [29/32 Reporting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XR1ECgiPZEo185oADs1NWqySrISSg7KguboPiSl8HWo/pubhtml?gid=167658153&single=true)\n\n\\#||Team|Δ|Record|Comment\t\t\t\t\t\t\n--: |:--| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--\t\t\t\t\t\t\n1.\t| [](/LAR) | Rams | \t--\t|\t9-2\t|\tHow's that for a dominate and stress-free statement win? All three phases were flawless as the Rams graduated from first in the NFC West to first in the NFC. MVP favorite Matt Stafford continued his insanity and has now thrown 27 straight TD passes without an INT, the longest ever streak; the defense has now allowed the least amount of points on the heels of an elite secondary; and the Thicker Kicker made his first FG. There's a lot of big matchups left, but vibes are high in LA.\n2.\t| [](/NE) | Patriots | \t+2\t|\t10-2\t|\tSo uhhhh… that wasn't a great game, was it? For the first time during this now 9 game winning streak, it really felt like the Patriots deserved to lose a game. Sure, they pulled out the win in the end, but pulling out a nail-biter victory against the worst defense in the league and an offense missing their qb, wr1, and later the wr2 feels more like a loss than anything. Couple that with the myriad of injuries hitting the o-line all at once (at one point the Pats were down 3 of their starting 5 linemen) and the uncertainty surrounding standout rookie Will Campbell’s knee injury and Pats fans likely left this game feeling worse than when it started despite the win. The fact that the bye week is still another game away is really hurting this team at present, though the only thing standing in between them and a 10 game win streak heading into their break is a date with the lowly Giants. Maye is going to have to regain his form from previous weeks if they want to continue this unbeaten run, as New England really needs him to play a bit better than he showed on Sunday if they want to survive the Giants ferocious front after the beating the line took. Vrabel’s excellent coaching job on the defense should hopefully keep them afloat until the offensive playmakers regain their health though. But hey, despite all the doom and gloom, lets really not forget that this is a 10-2 team on a 9 week winning streak. Last year this team finished 4-13. Just savor this moment for as long as it lasts. \n3.\t| [](/SEA) | Seahawks | \t+2\t|\t8-3\t|\tDear Jaxon, I feel like I can call you Jaxon because you and me are so alike. I would love to meet you some day. It would be great to have a catch. I know I can't throw as fast as you, but I think you would be impressed with my speed. I love your hair. You run fast. Did you have a good relationship with your father? Me neither. These are all things we can talk about and more. I know you have not been getting my letters because I know you would write back if you did, and I hope you write back this time and we get to be good friends. I am sure our relationship would be a real touchdown. Rooting for you always, Matthew\n4.\t| [](/DEN) | Broncos | \t+3\t|\t9-2\t|\tAh, the bye. I soaked in the sights and sounds of no Broncos football in comfort, sipping a fruity cocktail and watching Broncos/Chiefs highlights while soaking my feet in the blood of my enemies (it's good for my skin and nails). Have you ever basked in the glory of your team's success, which you had no part in, and felt better than anything you yourself have accomplished? I now have, and I've got to tell you I recommend it. True, the Patriots won and have taken the 1 seed in the AFC, and their remaining schedule looks more winnable than ours. But that won't stop me from enjoying this moment. Bring on the Commanders!\n5.\t| [](/PHI) | Eagles | \t-3\t|\t8-3\t|\tAnyone who watched Sunday's game and thought the Eagles played uncharacteristically badly hasn't been watching. In almost every game this season, we've seen 1) ridiculously hot and cold stretches with the passing offense 2) a nonexistent run game 3) a dominant defense that gives up the occasional splash play 4) loads of penalties 5) an inability to build a meaningful lead. All 5 of these things have been happening all season, the only difference between Sunday and the rest of the year is that the final score didn't point in the Eagles' favor. \"There's time to clean things up\" is true until it's not. Will this team be the 2023 Eagles and collapse down the stretch? Or will they be the 2024 squad and right the ship in time to score like 100 points in consecutive playoff games? Tune in Friday when the Eagles-Bears alliance will end in blood.\n6.\t| [](/IND) | Colts | \t-3\t|\t8-3\t|\tThis was a complete offensive collapse by the Colts in the 4th quarter and overtime. Head coach and play-caller Shane Steichen forgot his favorite mantra: \"Pass to score, run to win.\" Despite leading for almost 53 minutes of regulation, twice by 11 points, Indy's final first down came with just under 3 minutes left in the 3rd quarter. From that point on, the Colts ran just 16 plays. One was a field goal. Only four were rushes by Jonathan Taylor, their MVP candidate RB who would've helped take more time off the clock with an 11-point 4th quarter lead. His final rush of the game, on 3rd & 1 in OT, was out of the *shotgun* and [went for -2 yards](https://v.redd.it/1uw78siqff3g1). Chiefs RB Kareem Hunt had nearly twice as many rushes on the day, despite averaging slightly fewer yards per attempt (3.5 vs. 3.6 for Taylor). It's a major reason why Kansas City was able to dominate the time of possession (42:35 to 25:28) despite not leading for a single second of the game. The defense was in \"bend, don't break\" mode for the entire game, and it put Indy in position to win despite giving up nearly 500 yards of offense on 91 plays (remarkable when you stop to think about it). It even forced two crucial turnovers. The offense probably just needed one or two more first downs, and to ***run the damn ball***, and that was somehow too much to ask. Make it make sense.\n7.\t| [](/DET) | Lions | \t+1\t|\t7-4\t|\tLMAO the Lions won the football game ?????? Brian Branch half-assed jogged every time the ball was thrown near him (except for when a head-to-head tackle was there to be made!) and Wan'Dale Robinson ran through the secondary’s legs for a billion explosives while Amik Robertson was wholly distracted by the corgi race. And honestly, that’s super valid. You don’t walk Grizzly; Grizzly walks YOU. Fox’s broadcast makes me want to [REDACTED] every time fervent fascist cheerleaders kenny albert and jonathan vilma open their dogshit mouths to talk about everything but the play they just watched for some reason. Thank you for zooming in on Jaxson Dart picking his zits, I am glad to know he’s just like me instead of knowing that Kalif Raymond is injured and seeing what happened to cause it. I pray to Jahmyr Gibbs every night. My faith in that man surpasses a certain president’s faith in the head game of a certain other president. There’s a Kennedy joke in there somewhere but I regrettably will leave it to the imagination of the reader. Did I mention that Jahmyr Gibbs is the closest thing this godforsaken world can come to perfection? Well, him and Jack Fox. My glorious Jack Fox. 3 punts downed inside the 10. Beauties. Jake Bates is a masochist and kicks like Tarik Skubal pitches and we are so grateful for it. I am shipping Amon-Ra St. Brown stick-em and anti-fascist philosophy papers so he can maybe become sufferable again. This Thursday is one of the greatest Michigan traditions of all time — putting all Thanksgiving vibes and promises on a football game that has historically gone terribly in ridiculous fashion. This year it’s against Green Bay. Woopeeee!!! I choose to ignore any red flags from this game and be belligerently confident. It’s just more fun that way. FORWARD DOWN THE FIELD! A CHARGING TEAM THAT WILL NOT YIELD! AND WHEN THE BLUE AND SILVER WAVE! STAND AND CHEER THE BRAVE! RAH RAH RAH GO HARD WIN THE GAME! WITH HONOR YOU WILL KEEP YOUR FAME! DOWN THE FIELD AND GAIN! A LIONS VICTORY!\n8.\t| [](/BUF) | Bills | \t-2\t|\t7-4\t|\tAre the Bills an elite team? At this moment it is hard to answer that with yes. You can point to a plethora of reasons why the Bills are 3-4 in their 7, ranging from coaching to not having enough play makers for Allen. However I think the true problem lies in the inconsistency of this team. One week they look like the best team in the NFL and the next they look like the whole team has been zapped of their talent. All these issues were on full display on Sunday as the Bills offensive line didn’t block for Josh Allen allowing him to get sacked 8 times (shoutout Will Anderson) doubling the previous high this year. Then throw in a couple of crucial turnovers and a missed extra point and it's no surprise that the Bills lost another game they were favored to win. Next up the Bills continue their road trip against the Steelers in another game they are favored to win who knows what version of the Bills will show up might as well flip a coin.\n9.\t| [](/GB) | Packers | \t+2\t|\t7-3-1\t|\tMicah Parsons plays for my favorite football team, and that's awesome. He is absolutely relentless, he eats double and triple teams and still gets home. He moves around the whole line, he can beat a tackle on the outside or he can weasel his way through the interior and demolish a play from there as well. Micah was at the forefront of a defense that put JJ McCarthy in a headlock, and limited the Vikings to 9.6 *inches* per play in the second half, including giving Nine his 9th and 10th interceptions of the year. Can't ask for much of a better game from the defense, great performance all around\n10.\t| [](/KC) | Chiefs | \t+2\t|\t6-5\t|\tAre the Colts bad or are the Chiefs bad or are they both good or both worse? It feels like nothing was learned from this game, aside that Kansas city needed 11 points to come back in the 4th quarter, but they did just that to put on a clinic in overtime. A win is still a win, especially against a (still) top ten team.\n11.\t| [](/SF) | 49ers | \t-1\t|\t8-4\t|\tKyle Shanahan called the game like a 10 year old playing Madden, giving CMC the ball 9 times on the first drive, and a whopping 31 touches on the night. I guess he should be well rested since he was out almost the entirety of last season with injury, so its fine. Purdy ended 3 consecutive drives with an interception, including one in the end zone, but somehow it never came back to bite him in the ass, as the Carolina offense was just as inept. The team heads to Cleveland next week, as they continue through the “easy” part of their schedule (Ari, Car, Cle, Ten). Getting wins here will be crucial to their playoff hopes, as the last 3 games of the season are against 3 teams currently standing at 8-3 (Ind, Chi, Sea).\n12.\t| [](/CHI) | Bears | \t+1\t|\t8-3\t|\tThe Bears just keep playing close games and pulling it out. It's pretty surreal at this point to see it from a team known as perennial losers. At this point, Ben Johnson has clearly changed the franchise and placed himself squarely in coach of the year conversations. The Bears' remaining schedule is tough in a loaded NFC wild card race, so even at 8-3, they have a lot left to prove to make the playoffs. Getting their two best defenders back this week vs a reeling Philly team, this is the opportunity that every fan would have wanted back in August.\n13.\t| [](/BAL) | Ravens | \t+1\t|\t6-5\t|\tThe Ravens allowed fewer than 20 points for the 6th consecutive week to finally peek their heads above 500. Despite the team's drastic rise in the standings there's a looming sense of an identity crisis in Baltimore. The trio of offense, defense and special teams is as well rounded as ever but the holes on the roster are becoming more glaring by the week. The offensive line isn't going to magically get better, a stud pass rusher isn't going to suddenly arise from a cadre of mediocre performers, and Lamar Jackson doesn't appear to be getting healthier week by week. For now fans should be content seeing the team stack Ws but time is running out for the 2025 Ravens to figure out what they're truly exceptional at.\n14.\t| [](/LAC) | Chargers | \t+1\t|\t7-4\t|\tBye week. Thank god.\n15.\t| [](/TB) | Buccaneers | \t-6\t|\t6-5\t|\t[Sunday Night Football. Start really well, win the coin toss. Allow a TD pass. Allow another average 3&18. And a fluke INT. Then another average TD. Take responsibility.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aB3C0mjy6T4) ... Ok, sure, Todd Bowles is not the best head coach in the league. But is he one of the best defensive minds in he league? Ok, probably not, but is he a great coach who knows how to get the best of his players? Ok, probably not, but is he able to build up young rookies into bonafide starters? Ok, probably not, but is he a winner, who knows how to win no matter what? Ok, probably not, but is he at least good, creative playcaller? Ok, probably not, but is he smart in choosing coaching personel? Ok, probably not, but does he at least know when to call a timeout or a 4th down and when not to? Ok, probably not, but listen buster! Being a head coach is a serious, serious deal and is not as easy as it seems. For example, Todd Bowles inherited a team that finished 13-4 the season before he became a HC. Since becoming a HC he finished 8-9, 9-8, 10-7 and is currently 6-5. Yeah, of course, not only did he not improve the team and we actually regressed, but!!!! Do you think it's easy to take over a franchise you've worked with as a DC, with future HoFers and talented players and take the next step? Of course not! For example, take a look at Dave Canales who worked as an OC for Todd Bowles two seasons ago. The Panthers were 2-15 before him. Now they are 6-6. Or take a look at Liam Coen who was an OC for Todd Bowles last season. The Jaguars were 4-13 before Coen became their HC. Now, the Jaguars are 7-4. So being a head coach is not as easy as it seems. Bring on the late season run where we're decent before losing in a competitive wildcard game.\n16.\t| [](/HOU) | Texans | \t+3\t|\t6-5\t|\tObviously the story is this Texans defense sacking Josh Allen 8 times, but let's give some love for Davis Mills. Was he a world beater or any threat to CJ Stroud's job? Not at all. But he kept this team afloat with a 3-0 record during Stroud's absence, keeping them in the playoff race when they looked dead in the water just a few weeks ago. Now Stroud will be returning to face the Colts with the division lead getting closer.\n17.\t| [](/JAX) | Jaguars | \t--\t|\t7-4\t|\tIf I had a nickle for every overtime win the Jaguars have, I'd have two nickles. On a day in which it felt like the Jaguars should have been blown out by the Cardinals due to the whopping -4 in turnovers, they managed to hang in and find the dub. Like sausage making, the process isn't pretty but the results are delicious. The Jaguars are solidly in the fight for a wildcard playoff slot at 7-4. With the Colt's loss in KC though, Jacksonville certainly has December 7th starred on their calendar. Both JAX/IND match-ups occur in December this season, and both will have divisional and playoff implications. First though, the Jags must head to Music City and take care of business.\n18.\t| [](/PIT) | Steelers | \t-2\t|\t6-5\t|\tIf you’ve ever wondered whether or not we live in a simulation, just watch a Steelers game. It won’t help your view on things. But it’ll make you question other things like “what’s a secondary?” And “why **don’t** they like covering tight ends?” It was like watching the Battle of Helms Deep except instead of a mighty fortress everyone took refuge in cheap Coleman tents. That was a more winnable game than the Thursday night fiasco in Cincy and somehow it seemed more of a foregone conclusion. Why not let one of the best kickers in the league take a shot from ~65-yards? Boswell has a fucking leg. Instead, we let our backup QB piddle away our last chance at victory. Not that we win that game in overtime; our defense was dead on the field past the line. Credit where it’s due; Watt finally did something but everyone else took a fucking mental health day. And by mental health I mean detrimental to the mental health of everyone else watching. To close, I’d like to read a bit from the honest-to-God obituary of a local Pittsburgh man named “Wayne Olexa” which I expect will mirror my own when this team finally kills me: “Wayne Olexa, 76, of Crafton PA, formerly of Swissvale, PA passed away on Sunday, November 14, 2021, after a long bout with the Steelers.  He was at his home with family when they went into overtime against the 0-8 Detroit Lions and that was all he could take.”\n19.\t| [](/DAL) | Cowboys | \t+2\t|\t5-5-1\t|\t21 points defecit. 24 unanswer points. 2.2 rushing yards for Saquon. 106 yards and no points allowed in the final 41:32 of the game. After Dak threw a pick in the endzone, the game flipped completely. Dak has advanced to 36-9 against the NFC East, 46-19 at home, and become the franchise passing yard leader. George Pickens crossed the 1,000 yard mark, and Alijah Clark showed the meaning of never giving up on a play. After it looked like fans would be leaving early to beat traffic, Dallas pulled possibly the greatest comeback in a Sunday of great comebacks. \n20.\t| [](/CAR) | Panthers | \t-1\t|\t6-6\t|\tThis game was basically over in the first half when the Panthers got 3 INTs on Brock Purdy and they finished the entire half with just 3 points. Joke of an offensive performance. Pathetic. The play calling makes no sense, and the pass game as a whole looks trash, but maybe Bryce simply isn’t executing? Regardless, it sucks watching this team offensively. The defense played pretty good but then they stayed on the field too long and Horn got a concussion along with our 1st-3rd string LBs out so that’s a recipe for disaster. Bryce looks like he sucks again so hopefully we can play the Falcons five more times this season otherwise I don’t see anything too exciting happening the rest of the year. Good thing we finally got a prime time game.. Some how we are still in division contention but next week the LA Rams come to Charlotte and there is a legit chance the Panthers lose by 40 points or we keep it close and BY9 confuses everyone more. Cant wait. Keep Pounding.\n21.\t| [](/MIA) | Dolphins | \t+1\t|\t4-7\t|\tWeek 12 didn't give any help to the Dolphins faint playoff hopes, but they have nobody but themselves to be in this position anyway. The good news is they may have some reinforcements coming in the form of starting RT Austin Jackson, and their starting TE Darren Waller. They also have what should be two easy games against a really bad Saints team, and a bad but feisty Jets team. If they want to really get people to start paying attention to them as a threat for a wildcard spot, they need to handle business these next two games, and then they'll have a shot to get back to .500 when they face a tough Steelers team on the road.\n22.\t| [](/ATL) | Falcons | \t+1\t|\t4-7\t|\tAtlanta's total sack count after 12 weeks is now higher than any full season since 2004. Billy Bowman's injury was a blow, but the 2025 class continued to step up. Xavier Watts leads rookies in interceptions, while James Pearce Jr's and Jalon Walker's combined 2.5 sacks have them sitting atop the rookie sack leaderboard. With Rich McKay operating from the sidelines the pressure was on, but Cousins didn't waver. He looked as strong as ever playing comfortably under center. Atlanta struggled in the second half but a win comes when Tampa Bay prepares without a healthy Mayfield and Carolina faces a brutal remaining schedule. The Falcons most daunting opponent left isn't the Rams - it's themselves. Winning 5 of the next 6 might be enough to take the South, but they could just as easily lose to the Jets 6-24 as they could trounce the Seahawks.\n23.\t| [](/MIN) | Vikings | \t-3\t|\t4-7\t|\tAfter watching the Vikings amass -1 net yards of offense in the second half on Sunday, this next Sunday fans will get to watch Sam Darnold, the QB they let walk this offseason for cheap, continue his extraordinary pro bowl season.  It's so bleak fans are pinning all their hopes in UDFA QB3 Max Brosmer to save the franchise.  At least we're all going to die some day.\n24.\t| [](/ARI) | Cardinals | \t--\t|\t3-8\t|\tThis Arizona Cardinals team is  inevitable. They have blown so many fourth quarter leads this season that there was never a doubt they’d blow this one. Even with the incompetence of the Jaguars coaching staff and Trevor Lawrence, the Cardinals outdid them. When the Cardinals were trailing by 3 at the end of regulation, they were marching down the field. Then, after a big chunk play around the 30 second mark got Arizona down to the Jacksonville 11-yard line, instead of clocking the ball and taking a few game-winning endzone shots, the Cardinals wandered around and waited for 20 seconds to get a snap off, and deferred to overtime. In overtime, after going down 3, the Cardinals, on 4th and 2, had a red-hot Michael Wilson and Trey McBride as options. Instead, they tried to go for it all, and sent a downfield shot into double coverage to undrafted second-year WR Xavier Weaver. This level of coaching incompetence has to be studied. The fact that OC Drew Petzing is still employed by the Cardinals is by far the biggest indictment on HC Jonathan Gannon’s tenure, aside from the fact that he is an overall 15-30 in his 3-year stint. \n25.\t| [](/CIN) | Bengals | \t+1\t|\t3-8\t|\tWTF Bengals you didn’t even suck this week how can I get angry and upset about this? This was the most normal loss we’ve suffered, how am I supposed to write a blurb about that? Like what, do you people really want me to sit here and just talk about the game? Nothing remarkable was done, there you go that’s it. Fuck you Bengals, if you’re gonna lose this year at least make them funny losses, you can’t do anything fucking right.\n26.\t| [](/WAS) | Commanders |\t--\t|\t3-8\t|\tThere isn't much to root for this season save for the rest of the NFC East beating up on each other and Jayden Daniels returning to practice. Four division games left could go either way, even with a surpisingly stable Marcus Mariota at the helm for now. Dan Quinn's seat will continue to heat up unless he snaps both his own teams 6 game losing streak and the Broncos' 8 game winning streak next week.\n27.\t| [](/CLE) | Browns | \t+4\t|\t3-8\t|\tWe don’t want people to get overly excited or make grandiose statements with very little evidence to back things up, but Shedeur Sanders is the greatest Browns Quarterback of all time and will lead the team to multiple Super Bowl victories.  The team was banging on all cylinders with offensive production and ten sacks for the defense.  This was also the first Browns QB first time start win in nearly three decades, a streak of seventeen consecutive losses for Browns quarterbacks in their debut starts, a state dated back to the team's re-establishment in 1999.  The Browns will start Sanders next week against the 49ers.  \n28.\t| [](/NYG) | Giants | \t-1\t|\t2-10\t|\tIt took the Giants blowing yet another double digit lead via 4th quarter collapse for Shane Bowen to finally be banished to the land of misfit coordinators. Thank you, Lions. You have done a service for us. The Giants offense continues to look pretty good, while the defense continues to undo all of that every week in spectacular fashion. Hopefully, the return of Dart next week and a coordinator that doesn't take out their best player in the pivotal moments of a game will make for some less stressful football.\n29.\t| [](/NYJ) | Jets | \t--\t|\t2-9\t|\tThe Jets have clinched their 10th consecutive losing season. Thanksgiving is Thursday.\n30.\t| [](/NO) | Saints | \t-2\t|\t2-9\t|\tThe Saints offense put up a putrid performance against the 16th-ranked defense. While Alvin Kamara got injured, it hadn't looked good before then either. Yet the result would be more flattering if the idiot kicker hadn't missed two field goals you'd expect to be slotted in the modern NFL, but this one has been awful most of the year. Time to go to Costco and hunt for a replacement.\n31.\t| [](/LV) | Raiders | \t-1\t|\t2-9\t|\tI don't even know what to say here anymore, this is the worst i've seen us look in a while and we've put some really bad stuff out on the field over the century. I just want the season to be over and November isnt even over yet. Our only hope is losing out and praying to the football gods we hit on a QB or O lineman, which is of course a great feeling as a fan.\n32.\t| [](/TEN) | Titans | \t--\t|\t1-10\t|\tThe Titans lost to a complete Seahawks team on Sunday.  Cam Ward showed positive play throughout the game in a peak performance for his rookie campaign.  Titans rookie Chimere Dike was a bright spot in the game with his second punt return of the year paired with a last minute touchdown reception.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1p6of6l/official_rnfl_week_12_power_rankings/","permalink":"/r/nfl/comments/1p6of6l/official_rnfl_week_12_power_rankings/","score":61,"num_comments":169,"over_18":false,"stickied":true,"created_utc":1764104563.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Power Rankings","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
{"id":"1p6dta2","name":"t3_1p6dta2","subreddit":"nfl","author":"BaltimoreBadger23","title":"Panic, Don't Panic, and Not so Fast, my Friend. Week 12","selftext":"Continuing my Tuesday series for this season looking at the teams and fan bases that should be panicking based on the prior weekend’s game, those who might panic, but shouldn't, and then the weekly “Not so Fast, my Friend” in honor of Lee Corso and his amazing career - a team that won, but maybe should not feel so great about that win.\n\n\nLast Week in review:\n\n\nPanic: Chiefs - Beat the Colts in OT in an ugly game but a win in Dallas on turkey day could turn panic to hope. Judgment wavering.\n\n\nDon't Panic: Seahawks - Junk time TD by the Titans made the score closer but they handled business in Nashville. Judgement sustained.\n\n\nNSFMF: Bears - Held off the Mason Rudolph led Steelers at home. Judgement sustained.\n\n\nNotes before going into week 12: 1. Concern is not panic. 2. I don't use significant injury happening within a game as a reason to panic because it just changes all expectations.3. I also will not highlight the same team two weeks in a row unless panic turns to despair. \n\n\nHere are my picks for week 12 of the 2025 season:\n\n\nPanic: The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, lost 34-7 to the Rams in Los Angeles. Two weeks ago I had this team at “don't panic” after a tough loss to the Pats, but since then they got destroyed in the fourth quarter against the Bills then lost the first half to the Rams 31-3 before Baker went out. Whether Baker is back or not, the Bucs are scuffling hard. They have a tenuous half game lead in the division as the Panthers didn't look so good last night, but have some good wins under their belts as well.\n\n\nDon't Panic: None this week. While not every team that lost (who isn't already in despair) needs to panic, no one should feel good about how they lost, the Eagles blowing a huge lead, the Colts also blowing a solid lead, the Steelers losing the division lead, and the Vikings and Panthers both lost ugly. As for the Bengals and Cardinals, see below. Edit: forgot to include Buffalo who could also have been Panic part 2.\n\n\nNot so Fast, My Friend: The Detroit Lions, defeated the New York Giants 34-27 in OT at home. Coming off losses to the Vikings and Eagles with a victory over the Commanders in between, the Lions struggled to contain the nothing to play for Giants. Jameis Winston passed all over the Lions defense while also catching a TD. The Lions were able to tie it on a long FG at the gun set up only because the Giants being in “fuck it” mode tried for a TD when up only 3 instead of settling for a FG to force the Lions to have to go the distance to win the game. Instead the Lions, on the strength of a 69 yard TD run in OT, hold off the Giants but still sit in the 8 slot in the NFC. Thursday’s visit from a bit more rested of a Packers team (15 defensive snaps in the second half) looms large for the Motor City Kitties.\n\n\nDespair Part 1: The Arizona Cardinals, lost 27-24 in OT to Jacksonville at home. As stated before, despite being only one of two current NFL teams to play in every NFL season (the other being the once croos-town Bears) the Cardinals are the least relevant team in the history of the sport. That continues this season as they fall to 3-8 with three games against playoff contenders coming up.\n\n\nDespair Part 2: The Cincinnati Bengals, lost 26-20 to the Patriots at home. Also now at 3-8, the season was derailed by an injury to QB Joe Burrow as relying on an aging Joe Flacco was not the recipe for success. Burrow’s expected return on Thanksgiving night at least makes that game in Baltimore more interesting, but it's too late to save the season.\n\n\nAs always I welcome *friendly* comments, disagreements, and debates in addition to your own panic, calm, or concern.\n\n\nComing tomorrow: A pre-thanksgiving recap. I'll look at all the teams I categorized during weeks 1-10 and see where they are now.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1p6dta2/panic_dont_panic_and_not_so_fast_my_friend_week_12/","permalink":"/r/nfl/comments/1p6dta2/panic_dont_panic_and_not_so_fast_my_friend_week_12/","score":54,"num_comments":112,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764080860.0,"edited":1764084768.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
