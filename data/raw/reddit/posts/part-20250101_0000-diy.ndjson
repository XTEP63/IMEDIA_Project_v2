During COVID I just slowly watch the price climb and like everything else, never come back down. They have MRV8 and MRV 13 filters, with the latter costing approx 60CAD$ each!\n\nI just completed my 2nd order from AliBaba and feel comfortable sharing this (the 1st one was fine but... meh).\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/8CyKHFF\n\nLeft is clone, right is OEM. I specified the exact dimensions, as well as the # of pleats required, since that's a big part of how some cheaper filters (looking at you Amazon car cabin air filters) shave costs. Less pleats means less surface area, high flow restriction.\n\nFor this one, I specified an H10 filter. I had previously done H13 but I felt this was a bit too fine. Note that the Panasonic unit is intelligent - it will monitor the airflow to make sure it's getting what you asked via the front knobs.\n\nSpecs\nH10\n220mm * 95mm * 25mm\n5mm x 5mm foam on 3 sides - 2 short side, 1 long side\nminimum 70 folds\n\nI'll make a comment below and hopefully get mod approval before sharing the seller - I'm not affiliated at all, just super happy to finally get these filters. I paid 2USD$ each, and the minimum order quantity (MOQ) I think was 20 or 30. I got 40 filters, and I think shipping costs basically doubled the price :) Which isn't unusual.

(Not poured and don’t have room for full subfloor build) now what?\n\n\nCurrently the basement is finished (was when we purchased) and is just pad and carpet on concrete. We had a water leak and are replacing it all.\n\nThe contractor we wanted to use recommended the above, but as I’ve been reading everyone says don’t do plywood subfloor on the basement, and recommend all these thick subfloor builds. It’s pretty dry in our basement (as long as no one backs up the upstairs toilet and floods it) they said it’s for warmth and comfort. But it’s a basement. I don’t live down there and we used little space heaters anyways with the carpet. \n\nWe like the idea of LVP, but with all the confusion I’m tempted to just rip up carpet and have new put down and be done for a few years. \n\nIf we do allow them to move forward, what are my risks? Currently I see no vapor barriers anywhere down the basement. Not in the walls or on the floor. I don’t want to deal with mold… but I’ll sooner sell the place than fully demo the basement and put vapor barriers everywhere. \n\nI was told by someone else who does construction not to do a vapor barrier directly on concrete… there was a little flooring down before and they just did clear plastic, some foam underlay, then the flooring.

I dug out the side on the left of the picture.  You can see the downspout.  It connects to black corrugated pipe that runs under the dirt out to the side/driveway.  It was originally clogged which I'm sure caused pooling in that corner.\n\n\n\nWe bought the house 6 years ago and there has also been a smell leak in the basement.  There's a small vertical crack in the wall of the basement at the front of the house, and during very heavy rains, water will run down the crack, to the floor, and a small trickle will run along the floor to a drain.  No bulging in the wall or anything like that.  But, that small amount of water is preventing me from finishing the basement.\n\nI took some measurements, and the leak is coming from the exact center of the house, under the front door.  The problem is, we have a concrete landing there, about 10'x10' that is covered.\n\nMy guess is, on either side of that pad concrete pad, water is soaking into the soil (basically flower beds) and then running under the pad and to the crack.\n\nI dug out the flower beds this weekend, and the concrete pad is only about 6-8\" thick.  So while it's accessible to get under it by a bit, I can't completely dig it out to fill it in with more concrete.\n\nWould it help to pour some concrete into the corners to try to direct the water away from these areas?

I am spending a lot of time trying to find answers to technical questions such as how to calculate (or even estimate) suitable pipe grade and thickness, how many supports I need according to pipe and unit dimensions etc, and whether vertical or horizontal support bars are more important.\n\nI tend to go overdo my designs like when I made a bed out of lumber and koa wood that elephants could dance on. Waste of money and time. Also reduces portability when I want to break it down for transport. The three-tier shelf (147 long, 2M high and 55 cm deep - these are external dimensions) is not for military or industrial use - but I do worry about stability, strength and reaction to tropical heat (non- airconditioned but humidity controlled indoor storage unit in the tropics).\n\n  \nEach shelf will hold up to 12 kg and the total weight of stored boxes could be as much as 50 kg. So my inclination is to go with whatever PVC is stronger by thickness and chemical make-up. But I am dealing with strict space limitations and every size bigger means lost storage.\n\nThen there is the choice of horizontal surface (shelf) material.

The problem is they're scared of the heater randomly kicking on if they aren't currently asleep 🙃\n\nIs there a way to have better circulation? We're fairly certain it's not insulation because any rooms around it are fine if the doors are open, but have the same temperature changes if the doors are shut.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/1p61y1b/how_to_improve_air_circulation_of_a_room_that/","permalink":"/r/DIY/comments/1p61y1b/how_to_improve_air_circulation_of_a_room_that/","score":0,"num_comments":35,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764041138.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"help","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
