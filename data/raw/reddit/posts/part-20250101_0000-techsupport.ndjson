WAY overpriced, I think I spent around $6k on it. I know I should have built it, but honestly I don’t have the time and always wanted one of these since I was younger. \n\nAnyway, EVERYDAY at 10:47pm my internet goes out and it says “Network 2: No Internet Access”. It’s just this PC, my internet is not going out. Everything else in the house and everyone’s devices stay on. Referencing my Unfi Dashboard, it also still shows it as connected and online. Even though windows says there is no internet, and the device loses connectivity. \n\nIt’s hardwired with Ethernet. I don’t have many things downloaded on it. Just Firefox, Evernote, OneNote, and steam(with like 10ish games downloaded.). That’s it. \n\nI’ve went through the settings, tried googling it. I have no clue what to do. It’s driving me insane. What’s more weird is it’s the same time everyday, 10:47pm. The only way to fix it is to either close whatever I’m doing and restart the PC. \n\nAny advice would be wonderful :) ","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1p65rx1/everyday_at_the_same_time_my_pc_loses_internet/","permalink":"/r/techsupport/comments/1p65rx1/everyday_at_the_same_time_my_pc_loses_internet/","score":23,"num_comments":21,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764053742.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Open | Windows ","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Two days ago everything was working perfectly until I removed my single 8GB Samsung DDR4 stick just to check whether I could fit another stick beside it in slot 1 (I’m planning to buy a second RAM stick, but my CPU cooler sits really close to the first slot). The RAM originally had an aftermarket heatsink that wasn’t properly attached and didn’t even match the brand, so I removed the heatsink and tried the stick in slot 1. The PC powered on but none of the components worked (mouse didn’t light, monitor stayed black), so I put the RAM back in slot 2 (its original spot) and it worked again. Later I tested slot 1 again and surprisingly it worked that time too.\n\nThe next day, I noticed 80% RAM usage right after booting, even though nothing was open. After restarting, it went back to normal. Then today, my PC started doing instant tiny reboots while playing Hollow Knight , screen goes black for a second and Windows comes back immediately, no BSOD, no sound. This now happens in both slots, which makes me unsure if I damaged the RAM stick, the motherboard slots, or something else.

A really concerning error has just started popping up on my laptop, and I wanted a second opinion regarding what might be the problem. To give background info, I am running:  \nADATA SwordFish 2tb PCIe 3.0 x4 (around 6 years old)\n\nOn November 18th, I started getting the Event ID 7 code for bad blocks. At first, I only got around 7 instances back-to-back of the error. However, it has been getting more and more frequent.\n\nI've noticed that this error usually pops up before the disk errors start appearing:  \nSession \"Microsoft.Windows.WindowsUpdate.RUXIMLog\" failed to start with the following error: 0xC0000035\n\nToday, I checked my computer and I got SO many more instances of the error, which is really making me worry. I saw the same Event 2 ID pop up before the disk errors as well. In total this week, I have had the error pop up **969** times.\n\nI installed CrystalDiskInfo and HDTunerPro to try and get an idea of what is happening, but the results have left me more confused. I get a health status of 96% on CrystalDiskInfo, and 341 Media and Data Integrity Erros, alongside 124 Error Information Log Entries. However, the program says my SSD card is in good condition.\n\nI ran HDTuner Pro and only had two red sectors show up in the error scan, with the rest being green. The ADATA SSD Toolbox also qualifies my ssd status as healthy.\n\nSo, I've run out of tests to do and despite also installing any new Windows updates, I am still getting this error. I would appreciate any help on this, because if my SSD card is failing, I am more than ready to get a new laptop if need be.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1p6ts29/is_my_ssd_card_failing/","permalink":"/r/techsupport/comments/1p6ts29/is_my_ssd_card_failing/","score":1,"num_comments":5,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764117903.0,"edited":1764118264.0,"link_flair_text":"Open | Hardware","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I have to press the power switch to turn it off.\n\nThe first time I recorded this happening was when I played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and I thought it was making my GPU overheat or something, but I checked the thermals and it was alright. After I finished the game the issue stopped happening so I assumed it was just the game. However, it's been happening recently again.\n\nIt happened just now, a few minutes after I shut down TEKKEN 8 and I opened a particular Discord channel, so I think it's not game related. The other few times recently was whilst watching YouTube videos. There is no way my PC was overheating then, especially since it's winter now.\n\n  \nOne thing to note is that audio keeps playing when this happens, and everything still runs in the background. I've checked to see if this is a monitor issue but my monitor menu works fine and I can switch displays.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1p6t0y6/pc_shows_black_screen_at_certain_times_no_option/","permalink":"/r/techsupport/comments/1p6t0y6/pc_shows_black_screen_at_certain_times_no_option/","score":1,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764115870.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Open | Hardware","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I'm looking for guidance before I open the case.\n\n* **PC Model:** Lenovo ThinkCentre (motherboard: **IQ1X0MS**).\n* **Previous OS:** Windows (running in **Legacy BIOS** mode, I wanted to change because it the PC doesn't support Windows 11).\n* **New OS:** Successfully installed **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** as the **sole operating system** (no partitioning/dual-boot).\n* **Installation Process:**\n   * I made a bootable USB with Rufus using the Ubuntu ISO.\n   * During installation, while Windows used Legacy BIOS, I chose to install Ubuntu in **UEFI** boot mode\n* **Initial Status:** The installation finished successfully, the PC booted into Ubuntu, I used it briefly, and shut it down normally.\n\nThis morning, the PC failed to boot:\n\n1. The screen remains **completely black** (no BIOS splash screen, no display output at all).\n2. The PC immediately starts emitting a specific **Beep Code**.\n3. The pattern is: **Three Short Beeps, followed by One Long Beep (3 Short, 1 Long).**\n4. The sound is identical to the one in this YouTube video:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcED7g3uFDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcED7g3uFDg)\n\nOnline searching (including Lenovo documentation for ThinkCentre) confirms that **3 Short, 1 Long** is the code for **Memory not detected** or a **RAM initialization error**.  \n  \n**Coincidence:** It seems like a massive coincidence that a hardware error would appear the morning after a successful OS install. Is there any known mechanism (like heat cycling during the intensive install process, or vibration from handling the PC) that could have loosened a RAM stick, revealing a preexisting marginal connection?  \n  \n**Legacy to UEFI:** Could the switch from the old Windows **Legacy** boot to the new Ubuntu **UEFI** boot somehow have triggered a BIOS setting that impacts RAM initialization?\n\nBased on the strong diagnosis, my next step is to **Power Off, Unplug, and Reseat the RAM modules** in the motherboard slots.\n\nBefore I open the PC, does anyone have any further suggestions or specific experience with this exact Lenovo motherboard (IQ1X0MS) that might point to a non-RAM-related fix?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1p6slho/lenovo_thinkcentre_iq1x0ms_beep_code_3_short_1/","permalink":"/r/techsupport/comments/1p6slho/lenovo_thinkcentre_iq1x0ms_beep_code_3_short_1/","score":1,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764114745.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Open | Hardware","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

I want to achieve Ethernet-like wired speeds to both devices, but I can’t run Ethernet cables to their locations. The distance from my router to the devices is only about 6 meters (roughly 20 feet) across the room.\n\nI have fiber optic internet, and my current wiring setup includes a coaxial cable only at the router but not near the TV or PS5, so MoCA adapters aren’t feasible without installing new coax lines.\n\nI used powerline adapters about 5 years ago, and the performance was poor. I understand powerline technology has improved recently, with some models offering up to 2 Gbps under ideal conditions depending on electrical wiring quality. However, interference and wiring layout still impact effectiveness. this is why i added the info about newly built european apartment, i have no clue about the electrical wiring, etc.\n\nAlternatively, I’m considering high-quality Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems or wireless bridges that can deliver near-wired speeds over Wi-Fi and include Ethernet ports for my TV and PS5. Since I plan to buy a Wi-Fi 7 router anyway for future-proofing my fiber connection, I’m wondering if a Wi-Fi 7 mesh system would offer a more stable, faster, and easier-to-manage solution compared to powerline adapters in this kind of new apartment setup.\n\nif i understand this correctly, i would have the wifi 7 router at its designated space in an electrical box in the utility room, then place a wifi 7 mesh system next to my tv/ps5, and the mesh system features an ethernet port from which i could connect an ethernet port to my tv/pst?  \nplease correct me if im wrong\n\nDoes anyone have experience comparing powerline adapters vs Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems in similar environments? Are Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems reliable enough to deliver the low latency and high speeds needed for 4K streaming on my TV and fast downloads/gaming on my PS5 at that short distance?\n\nAlso, recommendations for Wi-Fi 7 router and mesh kits that perform well in apartments and support gaming/streaming would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1p6qn40/seeking_advice_on_achieving_ethernetlike/","permalink":"/r/techsupport/comments/1p6qn40/seeking_advice_on_achieving_ethernetlike/","score":1,"num_comments":5,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764109763.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Open | Networking","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

It essentially makes the game unplayable. The laptop has an Intel UHD and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX2060 with Max-Q.   \n  \nLooking at Task Manager, this is what I see happening (see image linked below as well):  \nFirst, as the game is running normally, I can see the Intel UHD GPU running at around 30% and the NVIDIA RTX at around 55%. Then, when the stutter/freeze occurs, it coincides with the Intel UHD spiking to 100% and the NVIDIA RTX dropping to about 5%. This lasts for about 10 seconds, and then it reverts back to normal. And this will happen every 3-5 minutes or so.\n\nImage of the Task Manager: [https://imgur.com/a/vabiH07](https://imgur.com/a/vabiH07)  \n*Apologies for the quality, did not make a screenshot on the laptop at the time*\n\nAttempted solutions:  \nI feel I have covered all the basics.

I’m troubleshooting an HP EliteDesk 800 G3 Tower with a critical issue regarding an M.2 SATA SSD (512GB) that contains important data.\n​💻 System Specs:\n​Model: HP EliteDesk 800 G3 Tower\n​CPU: Intel Core i7-7700 (Gen 7)\n​Storage 1 (The Problem): M.2 SATA SSD 512GB (Data drive - Currently Invisible)\n​Storage 2 (Current Boot): Standard SATA HDD (Windows boots fine from here)\n​BIOS Mode: UEFI (Latest firmware updated)\n​🛠️ The Context:\nThe system was originally configured with Intel Optane enabled (RAID mode). The M.2 SSD suddenly disappeared from BIOS and Windows. We suspected it was stuck in a \"concatenated\" Optane state or the BIOS settings were locking it out.\n​✅ Steps Taken So Far:\n​Boot Access: We managed to boot into Windows via the secondary HDD.\n​BIOS Changes:\n​Disabled Secure Boot.\n​Successfully changed \"SATA Operation\" from RAID/Optane to AHCI.\n​OS Level:\n​Booted Windows in Safe Mode, then Normal Mode to ensure drivers loaded correctly.\n​Checked Device Manager / Disk Management / Diskpart (list disk).\n​Reseating: Physically reseated the M.2 drive.\n​❌ Current Status:\n​Windows boots fine from the HDD in AHCI mode.\n​The M.2 SATA SSD is NOT detected anywhere. Not in the BIOS boot order, not in System Information (F10), and not in Windows Disk Management.\n​The drive gets power (gets warm), but no data handshake.\n​❓ The Questions:\n​Lane Sharing: Does the HP EliteDesk 800 G3 Tower disable the M.2 SATA lane if a specific SATA port (where the HDD is plugged in) is used?\n​Protocol Support: Is the M.2 slot on the G3 Tower strictly NVMe/PCIe, or does it definitely support M.2 SATA protocol? (The manual says both, but real-world experience might differ).\n​Optane \"Ghost\": Is it possible the SSD controller itself is locked in a proprietary Optane state that standard AHCI cannot see, requiring a specific reset tool?\n​Any suggestions to force the BIOS to enumerate this SATA M.2 drive would be lifesavers. We are trying to avoid formatting as data recovery is the priority.\n​Thanks in advance!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1p6nrp8/help_needed_hp_elitedesk_800_g3_tower_m2_sata_ssd/","permalink":"/r/techsupport/comments/1p6nrp8/help_needed_hp_elitedesk_800_g3_tower_m2_sata_ssd/","score":1,"num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764103108.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Open | Software","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

{"id":"1p6n8g4","name":"t3_1p6n8g4","subreddit":"techsupport","author":"Unusual-Amount5809","title":"Critical problem after updates (resolved)","selftext":"(Note: this is a copy-paste of the problem i made on r/samsunggalaxy, you can view the original post here\nCritical problem after updates (resolved)\n\nHello guys! I would like to show you one problem that almost bricked my phone and how i solved it for awareness and educational purposes (if anyone would have this problem, they may be helped by this post).\n\nAt around 22 november 2025, in the evening, i checked for updates my Samsung Galaxy A13 5G phone. I downloaded the update (November Security Update), and then scheduled the installation to 2:00 AM. Important detail: In the night, at around that hour, i'd seen the updates getting done (around half the line). Then, on the morning, i'd seen the phone restarting continuously (more precisely, the first turning on image, with \"SAMSUNG Galaxy\", \"Secured by Knox\" and \"Powered by Android\" text popping up), and then a blank (gray-ish) screen (practically, the black screen on LCD screens). This cycle happened continuously, (supposedly), for all the night, seeing it on the morning.\n\nI was very stressed, because the battery on this phone cannot be taken down, and i feared the phone doing this constantly, stressing me out until the battery dies and the phone becomes e-waste. But, with the help of my relatives, i found how to get into \"recovery mode\", where i saw the \"Power off\" option and could turn off my phone, drastically reducing my stress. I was thinking it is done, and the phone is bricked. I installed the critical apps on one of my family member's phone: the password manager – Proton Pass, the authenticator app – Authy, and my google account.\n\nI was thinking it is a bug within the delivered update, that made the phone bricked, and i was thinking to report it to Samsung, to solve the problem as soon as possible, before users with that phone model install the update and thus their phone getting bricked, like supposedly mine.\n\nAfter writing the report, i sent it by Samsung's whatsapp chat, with them saying that they do respond only Monday to Friday. Then, i was searching for some 24/7 support of Samsung, to report this \"urgent\", \"critical\" bug before people's phones get bricked. I found it! (You can find it [here](https://www.samsung.com/ro/support/livechat/#sprChat). Then, i talked to a specialist (who reponded in, like, one minute) who didn't know Romanian, but used a translation tool to talk with me.\n\nI copy-pasted the report i did for whatsapp, and he or she told me that it happens when system files corrupt during the update installation, and advised me to reinstall the system (by going to Wipe data/Factory reset within the Recovery Mode; i would explain how to do that at the end)\n\nAnd... it worked!!! The welcome message popped up! The phone is no longer bricked! All thanks to Samsung support for the saving of my phone. The sad part is that it wiped my recent data (Thank God that, about 6 months ago, i backed up my images and videos on my PC).\n\nIf i can give any advice from this story, this is the one:\n- Back up your system, either on an external drive, an SD card or a cloud provider, often; three months is okay for the average user.\n- Also, BACK UP YOUR DATA BEFORE ANY SYSTEM UPDATE, no matter whether it is a security update, stability update, Android upgrade or One UI upgrade. If a thing like this would happen to you, you'll not cry for your family photos after wiping data.\n\nNow, the most important one:\n\nHow to repair your Samsung phone if the phone keeps restarting continuously after a system update:\n\n- Keep calm;\n- When a blank screen appears, press the power button and the volume up button at the same time, and stop when \"SAMSUNG\" appears. Wait 4-6 seconds, a weird menu (which we call Recovery Mode) appears;\n- There, you move Volume up and Volume down to get through the options, and you use the power button to select an option;\n- Go to Wipe data/Factory reset;\n- Here, if you have an SD card, it may be a good idea to take it out of the phone (i don't know what happens to it when hard resetting);\n- Be counscious of the fact that all the data you have on your phone will be deleted, without any way back after going to \"yes\";\n- Click \"yes\";\n- wait a bit until it is done;\n- Then, go to \"Reboot\" (important detail: don't go \"Reboot with bootloader\");\n- Click the power button;\n- Wait a long time (about 5-10 minutes, 15 minutes maximum);\n\nIf you get to the welcome page – Congratulations! – your phone is no longer bricked.\nIf the phone continues restarting continuously, without landing on the welcome page, then – the Samsung specialist said – you need to go to a Samsung service to repair it. Sorry!\n\nI hope this helped you in any way, or at least you've learned something from my story. Stay – you and your data – safe, and God be with you!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1p6n8g4/critical_problem_after_updates_resolved/","permalink":"/r/techsupport/comments/1p6n8g4/critical_problem_after_updates_resolved/","score":1,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764101890.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Solved","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
