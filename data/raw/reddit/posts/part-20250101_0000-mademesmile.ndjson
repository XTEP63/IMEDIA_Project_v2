After dropping my older son at enrichment school, my little one and I went to a mall nearby.\n\nIn the atrium, he spotted a battery-powered puppy. It was cute, could walk and make soft sounds. We watched awhile, then moved on. But soon he pulled me back to look again.\n\nJust then, a young man came over and handed me the same toy. \"I saw your kid really likes it, I bought it for him,\" he said. He'd been eating at the Japanese BBQ place nearby and saw us through the window.\n\nI was deeply touched. This was the kind of story I’d only seen online—yet here it was, gently unfolding in my own life. That small act of kindness felt like a beam of light, shining right into my Sunday afternoon.  \n\nHe looked about 18 or 19—probably a college student home for break.  \n\nBut in my eyes, college kids are still just kids themselves. How could I let him pay?  \n\nI immediately took my son into the restaurant and went to the register to ask for their check. As it turned out, they had just asked for the bill. After some polite insisting, I succeeded in paying for their meal.  \n\nKindness goes both ways.
