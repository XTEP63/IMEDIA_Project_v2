{"id":"1p6jhj2","name":"t3_1p6jhj2","subreddit":"formula1","author":"woakula","title":"Bearman's Performance where HTB is Allowed/Banned: A logistic regression model","selftext":"Welcome to unserious stats with me, Woakula! With 2 days before Thanksgiving, I’m alone in the office and have just enough time to entertain myself with mindless nonsense before I go to lunch. Anyways I was intrigued by the table about Bearman’s performance where Hormone Treated Beef (HTB) is/is not restricted originally created by u/_StarDust_0. I figured it’d be fun to run it through a logistical analysis to see if we can find anything interesting.\n\nFirst off, I suppose I need to answer what is logistical analysis? Well, logistic regression/analysis is a method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a binary outcome. It predicts the probability of an outcome occurring which is represented as a 0/1 or a no/yes in this the case a top 10 finish.\n\nHere is the data courtesy of u/_StarDust_0, if you find errors here take it up with them, I just copied it without verifying the accuracy, as any good data scientist should.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l15n3ffxf3g1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9512a9aadbff9f8621856a5cd0629d245488f7e\n\n  \nHere are our variables:\n\n1.      Outcome variable is the race result (which I divided into top 10 finishes (0/1 or no/yes))\n\n2.      Independent variable is the approved status of Hormone Treated Beef (0/1 or banned/allowed)\n\n**Our question is: Does the approval status of Hormone Treated Beef increase the probability of Bearman finishing top 10?**\n\nMy 5 lines of code in R:\n\n>`model <- glm(race_top10 ~ HTB_numeric,`\n\n>`data = f1_bearman,`\n\n>`family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))`\n\n>`exp(coef(model))`\n\n>`summary(model)`\n\nThe line starting with model is our logistic regression model\n\nExp(cof(model)) converts the logistic odds-coefficient created in the previous step into an odds ratio which is more interpretable.\n\nSummary(model) is our output.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9pgwp5oxf3g1.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=381e00544bc049cdd2588935852879333df1e57c\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nLet’s take a look at our exp(coef(model)) line:\n\nThe intercept is 0.20. this is the odds of a top 10 finish when HTB is banned. We do need to convert this odds to a probability:\n\nProbability = odds / (1+odds)\n\nProbability = 0.2/(1+0.2) = 0.167 or 16.7%\n\nSo when HTB is banned, there is a 16.7% chance of Bearman finishing the race in a top 10 position.\n\nHOWEVER, when HTB if allowed the odds are multiplied by 11.667\n\nNew odds = 0.2 x 11.667 = 2.33\n\nConverting to probability: 2.33/(1+2.33) = .70 or 70%\n\nTherefore, When HTB is allowed Bearman has a 70% chance of scoring a top 10 finish. A whopping 53.3% increase compared to regions where HTB is banned. Get our boy some HTB!\n\n**What does the summary(model) line tell us?**\n\nWell our coefficient of 2.4567 tells us that we have a positive direction (when HTB is allowed the log-odds increase) we converted these log odds to probability in the previous step.\n\nThe p value (Pr(>|z|)) tells us if the relationship is statistically significant. In this case we have a p-value of 0.0179. This tells us there is a 1.79% probability of observing a relationship this strong (or stronger) between HTB approval status and a top 10 race finish for Beaman. This means the relationship is unlikely to be due to random chance alone (technically lol) We have \"evidence\" that HTB is a genuine predictor of a top 10 race finish.\n\n**But what about the confidence interval?** \n\nLet's run a 6th line of code:\n\n`exp(confint(model))`\n\nthis line calculates the confidence interval for our odds ratio which was calculated in step 2. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqarmy01yf3g1.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=085b69031badcbaf47394b003dd4d429cb09ff54\n\nLook at the HTB\\_numeric line, the lower and upper bounds are massive. Way too big to actually be useful in the real world, but for the laughs let's convert them to a probability anyways\n\nProbability lower bound: 1.77/(1+1.77) = .6389 or 63.89%\n\nProbability upper bound: 115.82/(1+115.82) = .9914 or 99.14%\n\nSo we are 95% confident that the true probability of HTB affecting a top 10 finish from Bearman lies somewhere between 63.89% and 99.14%. With such a large window there is a lot of uncertainty in our model. \n\nLet’s conveniently forget that for this to be real we need to come up with a plausible reason this relationship exists. I hypothesize that HTB is actually a performance enhancing substance that only affects our GOAT Ollie Bearman. When he races in countries where HTB is allowed he eats a big steak allowing him to digest all the drugs (cause that’s how this works in my universe). He shows up on race day and bam! An increased chance at a top 10 finish! Why isn’t his team bringing HTB with them everywhere for the performance gainz? Well idk, maybe a freezer it too expensive…..\n\nSo as I walk out the door in search of a sandwich shop which will sell me performance enhancing HTB I leave you with one final question? What wacky casual effect mechanism do you think connects HTB to Bearman's top 10 performance?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6jhj2/bearmans_performance_where_htb_is_allowedbanned_a/","permalink":"/r/formula1/comments/1p6jhj2/bearmans_performance_where_htb_is_allowedbanned_a/","score":47,"num_comments":12,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764093657.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":":post-statistics: Statistics","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Gnf2OaXuVZnC5cKDo5ZvqM0oD4r3oPGe1gME0xdXYas.jpg"}
{"id":"1p6gw61","name":"t3_1p6gw61","subreddit":"formula1","author":"ElectionMoney3911","title":"Could this year's title battle be compared to the 1986 season?","selftext":"Of course, the early and mid-season phases were different between '86 and '25. In '86, it was a four-way fight between Alain, Nigel, Nelson and Ayrton, while in '25 it was seen more as an internal battle between the McLaren duo—almost like another Silver War.\n\nHowever, with two Grands Prix left, I’ve found the two seasons to be quite similar.\n\nIn the ’86, Nigel led with 70 points, followed by Nelson on 60 and Alain on 59. Right now, Lando has 390 points, with Oscar and Max both on 366. Considering the points systems of each era, the trends look quite similar.\n\nIn the ’86, the title fight was between the two Williams drivers, who were competing with the constructors’ championship-winning team, and Alain, the defending champion driving a McLaren that was regarded as relatively uncompetitive. This year shows a similar pattern as well, with McLaren’s two drivers battling against the defending champion, Max.\n\nIn the end, Alain, sitting in third like Max currently, went on to successfully defend his title against Williams. Will Max be able to do what Alain did in ’86? What are your thoughts?\n\n(Apologies for my English, and thanks everyone for your comments.)\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1p6gw61/could_this_years_title_battle_be_compared_to_the/","permalink":"/r/formula1/comments/1p6gw61/could_this_years_title_battle_be_compared_to_the/","score":30,"num_comments":26,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764087942.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":":post-discussion: Discussion","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

The overlap area between the curves represents the chance that Verstappen finishes ahead of Norris in total points.\n\nVerstappen and Piastri are currently on equal points, so Piastri’s distribution is mathematically identical to Verstappen’s. I left it out to keep the chart clear.\n\n# Key Result\n\nThe probability Verstappen finishes the season with greater than or equal points than Norris is about 8%.\n\nThis isn’t a prediction; driver form, car pace, DNFs, and the usual chaos are not part of this model.","url":"https://i.redd.it/bofmns99ee3g1.png","permalink":"/r/formula1/comments/1p6bcc3/oc_probability_distribution_of_2025_final/","score":0,"num_comments":18,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764074191.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":":post-statistics: Statistics","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/_c4Z_TJkF1AzCGTrFd114SA052QrTX3-GKIxGN5USiM.jpg"}
