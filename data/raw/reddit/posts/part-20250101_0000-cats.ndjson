That’s my signal to pause and double scan the area.\n\nAlso please read the part where I said I go to parks where I don’t see dogs around, even if there was a dog that just happen to show up I would’ve seen it by then and my cats would've sense it from a mile away and I’ll just take them into the carrier and go, situations like this has never happened, I put my cats safety first.\n\nSince they were kittens they somehow automatically run to me whenever they feel scared, I’ve now started to carry their carrier with me while walking and somehow they know to jump inside if they ever feel scared, I tap the carrier to test this and they jumped in during walks to remind them that they have safe spaces with me, the last time they were spooked was seeing a dragonfly out of nowhere my cat she jumped on me to carry her, I understand the worry to train them and leash them, they don't get bothered by the leash at all, so either way they can be leashed or not, I just choose not too, me and my cats are well bonded and gone through everything they’ve never ran away from me left my side in any circumstance and I’m always looking everywhere and around for their safety, it might be funny to people but I trust my cats.\n\n**Also I live in Australia,** we don’t have squirrel, raccoons, coyotes, eagles anything of those sorts. The only realistic concerns are the occasional off leash dog or stray cat, both of which my cats would notice long before they get close and so would I.","url":"https://v.redd.it/vat7fylz9h0g1","permalink":"/r/cats/comments/1otmumn/do_you_guys_take_your_cats_for_walks_too/","score":252,"num_comments":109,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762801771.0,"edited":1762817216.0,"link_flair_text":"Video - OC","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://external-preview.redd.it/aXFhdGV6bHo5aDBnMYWjXKJxiXoROhJm8E4_h2IKOgkzADc1mKAgRhfmiy-_.png?width=140&height=140&format=jpg&auto=webp&s=a79e90f26904dabb39d633d101e288b73bfb7445"}

He's a polydactyl, he's tubby, he's fluffy, he likes to play but he is not a lover. All of our other  furry friends have been loving smugglers but not Fred. He was the last of the litter caught from under the bridge where he first lived. He was too rough for the other kittens at the shelter so he was always with the adults. We all love him enormously and would love to scoop him up roll him over on his back and shower him with kisses but he's just not that guy. \nWe want to add another cat or even the right age puppy /dog to the house but we fear Fred will go full on Kaiju Fredzilla, Fredanator, Fred Pool, Fred Dead Redemption and murder mitts another pet.\nWe love Fred and want what's best for him. Has anyone introduced another cat or dog to a lil' monster like Fred. Is there a protocol? I've seen all the tactics on YouTube and in this sub but I feel Fred has a bit more edge to him. \n\nAny advice or random thoughts about a new pet intro with our handsome boi boi Fred?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ou801z","permalink":"/r/cats/comments/1ou801z/hes_a_fighter_not_a_lover/","score":239,"num_comments":25,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762863624.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Advice","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/wEan5cPXv7Lnwb5a3OhVT2uNgxssq907kdk7Q8c2h_o.jpg"}

About 6 months ago my Grandpa passed away. This was the first major death in my life I ever experienced & trying to navigate through grief has been so hard for me. \nHis absence left a massive hole in my heart that won’t let me be. I saw a flyer where someone was offering up a kitten for adoption & something inside me just propelled me forward to head down to the shelter. I was nervous with the process but then this lil guy came up to me. He was so friendly to me & let me pick him up. The way he was just staying put and purring made me want to just take care of him for the rest of his life. I instantly found myself spoiling him, enjoying his company, & loving the way he seemed so comfortable to just lay next to me. I will always miss my Grandpa, I’m not sure if the grief will ever let me be, but one thing I’m sure of is, I’m starting to feel my heart start to heal thanks to this little guy. I promise him I will do my absolute best to be the best cat dad I can to him. He is now my baby.

{"id":"1ou0861","name":"t3_1ou0861","subreddit":"cats","author":"Xiao_Qinggui","title":"Update: Taking in my best friend’s cat and dog","selftext":"Hi, everyone!\n\nI just wanted to post an update on how things are going for my friend’s dog and cat - This time with pictures!\n\nFor anyone who didn’t see my last post, my best friend and neighbor passed away suddenly last Sunday.  She and I knew and loved each other’s animals to where we had a promise that if anything happened to one of us we’d make sure all the pets would be taken care of.\n\nI got her dog (Lilly) on Sunday and her cat (Terry) the next day, we couldn’t find him at first and I was afraid he somehow got out when the paramedics showed up. \n\nThe dog is finally using her dog bed at night instead of sleeping in my lap but she still has to be in my lap whenever I’m in bed,. I’ve been trying to find her a home among my other neighbors and, hopefully, her new owners will take her for a few hours soon to see how she acts. She’s actually a trained service dog, my friend always told me that if I saw her dog wandering around alone to follow her. One of neighbors I’m trying to pair her with is in a wheelchair so I’m hoping Lilly’s service dog instincts will help out in getting her used to a new home - I live only a few doors down and will be on call if she gets anxious or they need a dog-sitter.\n\nThe cat is a little more of a challenge to find a home for - He’s anxious around new people and the only two people he knew and trusted were my friend and I - He was a stray that was crying in our complex’s parking lot a little over two years ago, she adopted him only because I didn’t think I could sneak an extra cat into my apartment (I’m someone who has to avoid ALL stray animals, I get too attached too quickly). He’s not hiding as much as before and started playing with my cats a little. He finally let me pet him without hissing a few days ago and he’s eating again.\n\nThey’re both still mourning along with me, I wish I could somehow keep both of them because I absolutely love these two. Terry is part Nebelung which is my favorite breed of cat, he reminds me SO much of my second cat with how he looks and acts, he’s scary smart at times.\n\nAs for Lilly, I’ve always loved small dogs and wanted a chihuahua when I was a kid - She’s sitting in my lap while I type this post, I love any animal that can sleep in my lap like this.\n\nAlso, I know this is r/cats but I have to say this: Lilly is not only the first dog I’ve ever had since living on my own but also the first small dog I’ve ever had in my entire life….Andthere is no word in any language that can describe how much fun it is to sit up in bed, look Lilly in the eye and see her reaction when I scream “LET’S GO WALKIES, LILLY!!!!!!”\n\nIt is SO much fun seeing her get hyped up for it.\n\nMeanwhile, Terry sits off to the side, rolls his eyes and thinks “Weirdos.”","url":"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ou0861","permalink":"/r/cats/comments/1ou0861/update_taking_in_my_best_friends_cat_and_dog/","score":16,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762835586.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Update","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/3jw4CdozjyC43SipHq9iolsufs4A4Ui0yGFwq99VnHU.jpg"}

And since moving in Theres this cat that comes every morning and every night, wether it’s at the front or back door and meows constantly until we open the door and give her attention. This wouldn’t be the first time we had a cat visit my family, at my other house my neighbor’s fat kitty would walk over and enter our house like it owns the place. But to be fair we know him because he’s our neighbor’s. I have no idea who this cat belongs to, she comes every morning and every night staring at us through the glass doors, meows at us until we pet her. Initially we tried feeding her tuna but she didn’t eat anything, we have water for her outside. She’s kinda fat but my dad thinks she might be pregnant, she likes me to pet her head, literally leans in whenever she sees my hand in her line of vision. She doesn’t seem to like it when I try to pet her belly or for me to pick her up. She does purr whenever I pet her. I think my question is, is it normal for a cat to do that? Is it normal for a cat to crave attention like that? She seems to trust me and she doesn’t look skinny.

On the first night she was home, she slept right next to me in bed because I was crying because I was bullied at school that day. She barely knew me but still gave me love like family, which she is family. \n\nEvery night she would sleep with me and give me a lot of love. Whenever I cried she would come over and sit on my lap and purr. We loved each other so much. Alice even got an official license to be an emotional support cat, which was incredible! \n\nUnfortunately, sometimes the brightest souls get to go home early. She developed mammary cancer. We spent thousands for multiple surgeries trying to save her, but unfortunately on the last surgery they realized it had spread outside of the mammary area, meaning it was going to be fatal. \n\nAs she began to show signs of sickness, we decided it would be in her best interest to pay a vet to come put her down in the comfort of her own home. She took care of me for years, and now it was my turn to take care of her and comfort her. On the last night, I carried Alice to bed with me, and brought her into mom’s bed where all three of us slept. Mom was whimpering and Alice put her paw on my mom’s hand, as if she was saying “it’s going to be ok grandma, don’t cry, I will be better soon.”\n\nAfter she was put to rest, I felt complete devastation as if I lost my world. Alice was a big part of my life. People expect you to get over it faster just because it’s a pet. Loosing a pet can be just as bad as loosing a close family member. \n\nA lot of times I would wake up in the morning and feel around the bed for her, only to realize she was gone. \n\nIf you’ve ever lost a pet, I feel your pain. Even if years pass, it’s still ok to cry. Just know that your baby would want you to be happy, and when you’re ready, give that love to another animal who will be with you and love you unconditionally. They would want you to celebrate them, not mourn them. They’re never gone. They’re always right in your heart, and that can never be taken away. It’ll be alright ❤️\n\nThank you for reading this and I hope I didn’t upset anyone. I only wrote this in honor of someone who kept me going, and to also provide comfort to other pet owners out there who may need some words of support and to know they are not alone. \n\nLove you all ❤️","url":"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ou6ng2","permalink":"/r/cats/comments/1ou6ng2/in_memory_of_alice/","score":11,"num_comments":2,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1762859099.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Mourning/Loss","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/11jVukIz55cxMcIwwngusdeY4FtCbbHJ_1phSPkLNao.jpg"}

He was my bestfriend and there for me through a lot, he loved to get big stretches and play fetch and was a cat gravy enthusiast. He was so vocal you could talk to him for hours, all he wanted was to be in your arms and cuddled. \n\nThis weekend out of the blue he couldn’t walk or pee and was in excruciating pain when I got home from work. I rushed him to the animal ER at 11pm on Saturday and they took him back gave him some pain meds and ran a few scans and labs. The scans showed he had been developing crystals at an astronomical speed they estimated since his last check up 8 months ago and had developed a stone roughly the size of his bladder. They offered a week long surgery and recovery with reconstruction that I was willing to put on my credit card but they told me with how invasive it was he was going a 50% survival rate and more than likely would be catheterized for life and have other quality of life issues if reconstruction and medications for the week were successful. The veterinarian said he more than likely has been in pain and suffering for months and not shown any symptoms to me, because as we know cats don’t want us to see them in pain, which he was good at since the day before he was jumping on my fridge and onto my shoulders for me to hold him and give him a treat or some turkey. He was a strong good boy and I will miss him. I made one of the hardest decisions of my adult life this weekend and decided to put him down. I held him on his pain med for 30 minutes before they came in and I could tell he was ready to be done with the pain. Love your babies hold them close.
