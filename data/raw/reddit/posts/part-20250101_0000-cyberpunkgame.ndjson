Then, because I didn't want anyone to die, I decided to do the secret ending, \"The Reaper\" (Don't Fear). After that, you go to Arasaka Tower alone with Jonny. If you're not leveled or have upgrades like implanted chrome, don't try this ending, as the moment you die, the game ends and you're sent to the end screen. Although everything was great, it was difficult because my health bar and Netrunner skills were draining, but it wasn't difficult. My health items were very good, and don't forget the high level of the enemies, but as I said, no one dies in this ending. You survive, but if you die, the game ends. In this ending, you become the head of the Afterlife. The blue-eyed man gives you one last heist mission, a big heist, and tells you that if you succeed, you'll gain a lot, even something life-changing.  I don't know what that means, but I think he's talking about a cure, a glimmer of hope, so V has six months, and Songbird went to the clinic on the moon thanks to this guy. So, the valuable thing he's offering us here is a cure, which I think is a very good ending.\n\n\nAnd finally, I have always wanted to destroy this demon nest.

{"id":"1p6t61j","name":"t3_1p6t61j","subreddit":"cyberpunkgame","author":"snGbrd77","title":"What are some of your personal customs and minigames that you have come to adopt in your playthroughs? I have a simple racing minigame to share by the end of this post","selftext":"From the very beginning of my current playthrough as a corpo V, I decided to go as realistic as possible and, as a result, some personal customs and minigames arose that I have come to enjoy dearly (maybe I'll inspire you to try some of them or make your own!) such as:\n\n**Customs**\n\n* No minimap and minimal HUD assistance: only HUD options on are the lifebars (V's and the bosses'), the action buttons (to get a sense of how long Sandesvistan will take to recharge) and the gun ammunition information (since from the first visit to Vektor's clinic, you are supposed to able to see such information after getting the Kiroshi optics implant).\n* Inside-the-car camera view only while driving and no autodrive: disabling the minimap and planning your routes using the regular map allows you to learn and, eventually, understand this quite complex city layout. It is quite fun when you get used to specific routes leading to some of your most visited places and when you are even able to guess, somewhat accurately, how to reach some new location. Also, you will be actually looking at and enjoying this beautiful dystopian city a lot more. Trust me, no minimap and inside-the-car camera view will be the only way of playing for some of you after trying it.\n* I have cars for gigs and cars for leisure. I don't park right in front of a Santo Domingo place, where the gig's to be done, in a bright Rayfield Aerondight \"Guinevere\".\n* Three meals, a bathroom room use and (at least) one shower a day: having to go places to get meals three times a day (and deciding to try most or all of the places) helps you learn the city faster, for example, I quickly learned how to get from building H10 to Kabuki market for breakfast (another place is nearby also, in the roundabout next to it). Another route I enjoy plenty, while in the need of visiting Westbrook, is from building H10 to the stand north of Japantown: instead of taking the route directly toward the Medical Center as I do while heading to Kabuki market, I take the one east side of that one that leads toward Lizzie's bar, in order to later make the exit leading straight north of Japantown.  Sometimes I get dinner straight from the vending machine of the apartment, if I feel lazy or not in the mood of going out again.\n* No crazy 5-gigs-in-a-day days or similar: in my current playthrough, I only do what seems realistic to me, for instance, one gig or mission objective a day; maybe stop a couple of robberies or attend an NCPD call and that would be all for the day. Then I spend some time doing other activities: visiting clothing stores, walking the city, having a drink at a bar, finding good spots for pictures, reading the databank, maybe one of the side quests of the lighter kind, etcetera.\n* I, at some point, go to sleep every night and take one or two in-game days a week to only do non-violent activities (I keep a diary of the things I have been doing each in-game day, in order to know when I should take a break from \"working\", and because I'm curious to know how many weeks it will take V to finish this \"realistic\" playthrough; I'm on week 3 currently).\n* I dress everyday: I pick a different outfit everyday from the inventory and only use the saved ones for occasions that don't require creativity, such as, the whole black, tactical, and covering-of-the-face one for gigs.\n* Realistic inventory: I only carry one light weapon with me around, currently a Kenshin tech pistol and, if I'm headed to some gig, I replace it close to the destination for a couple of heavier ones from the trunk of the car (an SMG and a shotgun, for example). After advancing more in the story I'll likely only end up using an SMG or assault rifle (depending on the terrain) and the mantis blades. I choose my weaponry based on what V would be most familiar with and enjoy most, not based on statistics; that's why I mostly go with Arasaka firearms and, ocassionally, a Militech Omaha, since it is a preferred choice of high level corpos.\n\n**Minigames**\n\nThe high way circumventing most of Night City allows you best compare the feel and top speed of the cars. I start from the parking lot exit of building H10 (the one at the top level without a roof)  at the spot right before the merge with the highway at 11:00 pm (some of the cars have a visible clock on the board, or you can just go to the inventory) and do the whole highway as fast as I can which will lead you back to where you started if you take no exits except the one that leads back to where you started).\n\nI started this today and my Archer Hella did 58 (in-game) minutes, reaching a 104 mph top speed. I'll try timing the Quadra Sport later and keep track of how I do with each car I get.\n\nWhat are some of yours?","url":"https://i.redd.it/01703ho6bh3g1.jpeg","permalink":"/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1p6t61j/what_are_some_of_your_personal_customs_and/","score":7,"num_comments":18,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764116247.0,"edited":1764116864.0,"link_flair_text":"Discussion","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://a.thumbs.redditmedia.com/HcCjevTqMzYTghHtomPOeCWMTJYY1yCnTHU9NBAZvq0.jpg"}

If she isn’t the president of NC then why does everyone hold her in such regard and why does she claim Yorinobu is breaching some accord by doubling his NC troops?
