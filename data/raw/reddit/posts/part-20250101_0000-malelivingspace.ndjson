Is that weird or is it pretty normal in a one-bedroom setup?\n\nOn top of that, I also want to have a second desk in my bedroom for a gaming setup. Would it make more sense to:\n•\tmove the bed further toward the wall to make room for the gaming desk which may decrease room mobility \n• keep the bed where it is and just get a smaller desk? \n\nThere is a door between the bedroom and living room that isn’t shown. I also don’t have room dimensions but it’s a 770 sq ft apartment.\n\nThanks!\n","url":"https://i.redd.it/1s26l77urf3g1.jpeg","permalink":"/r/malelivingspace/comments/1p6i7qz/29m_could_use_some_layout_advice/","score":3,"num_comments":9,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764090860.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Advice","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/QGvUnGJIYX3YWyUs1vr5U7KS_6_yzVEsMPNd9x5bkJw.jpg"}

There are hardly any fixed or ceilinged rooms on the inside. The house is 6m wide by 20m by 4m house (or 20 by 65 by 13 in freedom units). The 6m sides are generally covered in window, and contain front and back door.\n\nCurrently, we're thinking of a large renovation. In any floor plan we're designing, we're stuck with quite a substantial hallway of 1.5-2m by 12m. Although we kinda need the hallway function (e.g. for access to the garden), we struggle to find a purpose for the place that justifies its' surface area. Secondly, the way this hallway stretches from front to back kinda elongates the house, it's like you're always drawn to the other exit.\n\nWe're at the point where any outside perspective & fresh ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\nEdited to add picture\n\n[From the centre of the house, looking towards the front door.

This might be a little outside the norm for this subreddit, but I’m looking for some interior decor advice related to a stereo speaker setup in my room. I’m planning to add a few acoustic panels to help reduce some of the reverb, and I could really use some help figuring out which colors/designs would work best with my space.\n\nI’m currently deciding between panels from GIK Acoustics and Acoustimac. I already know the size I want—three panels at 4 ft × 2 ft × 4 in—so that part’s set. What I’m struggling with is choosing a style that fits the room.\n\nHere’s a photo of the wall where the speakers and the acoustic panels will go: https://i.imgur.com/DAI1YHX.jpeg\n\nTwo panels will go on that front wall, one behind each speaker. The third panel will be mounted on the left wall, right in front of the left speaker.\n\nHere are two wider shots of the rest of the room for context:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/HhIAYtO.jpeg\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/osKVW5d.jpeg\n\nThe three canvas prints currently resting on the headboard used to be mounted with Command strips, but they kept falling. I'll be properly remounting them soon.\n\nI know the lighting in my photos is not the best. The color of the speakers is not very clear. They are KEF R3 Meta in indigo: https://i.imgur.com/hDM0VXH.png\n\nAs for the acoustic panel design and color I am considering, I've been looking at GIK's Amplitude Bass Trap Panels:\n\nhttps://www.gikacoustics.com/products/amplitude-bass-trap-panel?variant=51819200577749\n\nThey come in a variety of colors, with different pattern scatter plates on front and different panels for the scatter plate.\n\nThe one I though *might* work in my room is the Walten color (kinda close to indigo?) with the Braid pattern plate and the walnut wood finish:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/qTZMY28.png\n\nI’d really appreciate any thoughts on how this combination might look behind/next to the speakers and how well it fits the overall room aesthetic.\n\nAnd definitely interested in any other color/pattern combinations anyone might think would fit better with the room?\n\nFinally, I might also consider the more plane, solid color fabric options from Acoustimac, if anyone thinks something from there might be a better fit:\n\nhttps://www.acoustimac.com/bass-traps/suede-bass-traps/bt-4000-bass-trap-2","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/malelivingspace/comments/1p6g5su/advice_on_acoustic_panel_design/","permalink":"/r/malelivingspace/comments/1p6g5su/advice_on_acoustic_panel_design/","score":1,"num_comments":1,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764086339.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Advice","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Using select photos or paintings from the Gallery+ App, the TV also doubles as a digital art display when not in use, and there are so many great options to choose from.\n\n\n\nTo complete the look, I added two bar corner cabinets to fill out the wall. I plan to wall-mount the G5 eventually (it’s practically designed for it), but I discovered my wall needs some work before I can hang it properly.\n\n\n\nMy first impressions of the display were pure wow. The brightness and color pop in certain scenes, while the deep blacks of OLED technology make dark scenes almost invisible — in the best way. It’s made me want to rewatch old favorites; I tested it with Interstellar and some gaming on Battlefield 6. The responsiveness is excellent, and the fact that it supports up to 165 Hz at 4K is amazing. Pairing it with a PC and console setup is next on my list for the entertainment center.\n\n\n\nComing from an older 55” Samsung plasma, the difference in clarity, performance, and thin design is night and day.\n\n\n\nAreas for improvement:\n\n\n\nThe main menu UI can feel a bit cluttered, with too many icons and app shortcuts competing for attention.\n\n\n\nThe remote design could use some refinement — I miss having a dedicated Input button, and I wish there were more flexibility to remap branded buttons. Not everyone has subscriptions to all the listed services, and customization would make it feel more user-friendly.\n\n\n\nOverall, the LG OLED G5 is an outstanding TV. The deep blacks and HDR performance are a massive step up from older displays, and once it’s wall-mounted, it’ll be the centerpiece of my living room\n\n\n\nI will eventually wall mount it but the wall there had some issues and need to get some work on it and will also run wires thru the wall to make it a clean setup with the provided flush wall mount it comes with since its designed for it.
