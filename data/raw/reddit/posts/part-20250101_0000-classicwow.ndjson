It's called **BeastAndBow**.\n\nIt's a simple, lightweight utility frame that tracks your resources so you don't have to constantly open your bags.\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* 🏹 **Smart Ammo Tracker:** Shows your exact ammo count on screen.\n* 🔫 **Intelligent Button:** The vendor button dynamically changes text/icon based on your weapon. Equip a Bow -> it searches for Arrow vendors. Equip a Gun -> it searches for Bullet vendors.\n* 🚦 **Visual Warnings:** The text changes color (Green/Yellow/Red) based on how much ammo you have left.\n* 🍖 **Pet Food Finder:** Helps you find the nearest vendor for Meat, Fruit, Bread, etc. with one click (uses TomTom if installed).\n\nIt's my first ever addon project, so I'm super excited (and a little nervous) to share it. I just updated it to **v1.0.1** to include better support for Guns/Bullets.\n\nI would love to hear your feedback or suggestions!\n\n**Download on CurseForge:** [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/beastandbow](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/beastandbow)\n\nHappy hunting!","url":"https://i.redd.it/dca4o7zvzf3g1.png","permalink":"/r/classicwow/comments/1p6jlfn/i_wrote_my_first_addon_because_i_kept_running_out/","score":269,"num_comments":56,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764093890.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"AddOns","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/Hw5unbBM_9JJCrcX728vh0Xu889Qyl6ds5Hks3gefeA.jpg"}

However, I have a 56 Druid now and it is a lot of fun playing in Vanilla - I will probably be 60 in the next week or so. If there is no possibility to stay in TBC, I am thinking about transferring her to the Era servers and level in pre patch a Draenei Shami because I already plan to do that, maybe even have her as main. \n\nI would only like to stay in TBC or Era, if the server continues to Wrath without the option to go to a TBC era server, I won't touch my characters on the Wotlk Anniversary server anymore tbh, and that would be a shame.\n\nLastly for consideration, I see it as cool perk to have a classic pvp rank in TBC. But that's only possible with my Druid since I don't have another character, everything else is below 20. Let's say I buy this expensive boost from Blizzard, transfer my druid and have a boosted druid on the anni realms, I will lose the pvp rank.\n\n\nWhat do you think would be the best?\n\n- Keep Druid on Anni server and risk not playing her anymore when Wotlk Anni comes without tbc transfer\n\nor \n\n- Transfer Druid to Era, have her as era main & level shami as tbc anni main\n\nor\n\n- buy the god damn boost, transfer druid, boost new druid (but it is very expensive)","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1p6sl32/what_to_do_with_my_anni_druid_and_will_there_be_a/","permalink":"/r/classicwow/comments/1p6sl32/what_to_do_with_my_anni_druid_and_will_there_be_a/","score":0,"num_comments":7,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764114713.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Classic 20th Anniversary Realms","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

{"id":"1p6dhz2","name":"t3_1p6dhz2","subreddit":"classicwow","author":"kmaho","title":"Paladin v Druid v Shaman for TBC main with a dungeon/BG focus?","selftext":"Love the hybrid classes apparently but having trouble deciding which to main at the start of TBC.  I'll probably play them all at some point, but where to start?\n\nI'm a dadcore level player getting in a couple hours a night after the kids go to bed and looking forward to hammering out dungeons and having some fun in BGs but haven't yet found a guild that seems like raiding could fit my schedule (and my interest in a more casual fun first raiding environment) so expect raiding will be limited to pugging for a while.  I don't really have any interest in arena. \n\n  \nThat said, I currently have a paladin that I just got to 60 (Dreamscythe US Alliance).  Really love the dungeon tanking option here but holy is kind of boring just spamming two spells and dungeon wise I'm always seeing a million healers looking and usually short tanks and DPS, oddly.  I've never tried Ret, but not sure seal twisting would be up my alley.  I feel like pally would give me great gold making potential and I can always run extra dungeons as prot to roll on offspec gear.  Not sure this would be very fun in BGs though?  \n\n  \nI've also got a druid I just got to 40 and am looking to finish to 60 before prepatch.  Had a ton of fun questing with it last week with that world buff.  So much better than leveling as prot pally was in the open world.   I still enjoy tanking dungeons but holy crap is it more effort than pally.  Very hard to hold hate on a group so far.  Bosses, much easier though.  As much as I like the tank/healer dual spec options, I'd also consider going boomkin/resto dual spec for a little more gear sharing.  Resto seems like it could feel strong in BGs spreading hots around, but not sure about feral/boomy in BGs.  All the info I find is Arena focused, which I again don't care about. Gold making options seem lower to me.  I fully expect open world herbing/mining to be really bad which seems to be druid's bread and butter.  Love the built in epic flight form goal and chasing that bird mount at the same time.  Also, free flight forms saves me like 1000g?  Nice bonus!\n\n  \nFinally, the shaman.  So many times I wish I had a tremor totem leveling or a purge.  Will push one of these during pre-patch but with my schedule I'll likely not be 60 yet before the gate opens putting me a little behind, but that could be good to avoid some of the crowd?  I'd level enhance but probably wind up ele/resto dual spec at the end again because it seems like they'd share at least some gear (maybe not BIS but at least useful for both while chasing BIS).  Lots of times leveling my pally where DPS was in oddly short supply, though heals were often abundant.  Both ele chain lightning and resto heals seem like fun in BGs.  Coming into anniversary recently, I was initially expecting to main this but leveled the paladin first for gold.  Gold making on shaman seems the least viable, but maybe I could buy up the mats to be one of the million jewelcrafters at launch and see if I can make some money prospecting like I did in OG TBC.  I doubt it in megaserver land. :)\n\n  \nAnyone more experienced with the classes and want to chime in to help me decide what to start with from my more casual dungeon/BG focused lens?  Most of the info out there is raid/arena focused.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1p6dhz2/paladin_v_druid_v_shaman_for_tbc_main_with_a/","permalink":"/r/classicwow/comments/1p6dhz2/paladin_v_druid_v_shaman_for_tbc_main_with_a/","score":0,"num_comments":7,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764080092.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Classic 20th Anniversary Realms","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

{"id":"1p5zovp","name":"t3_1p5zovp","subreddit":"classicwow","author":"Kitchen-Training-424","title":"classic+ monk class pitch","selftext":"100% no shame AI-slop, but I did put like an hour or so of prompting into this around eliminating channeled abilities to fit classic melee, some ideas around fistweaving, and providing an additional windfury option (assuming pallies and shams would be cross faction for classic+, and in lieu of FoF redesign lacking cleave).\n\nI get if you don't like any of the particular ideas in this post; but if/when classic+ ever becomes a reality, I would really enjoy playing monk in a classic setting and maybe by some miracle this gets enough upvotes or conversation that blizzard actually sees it and that happens.\n\n# A Classic+ Monk: Introducing a Martial and Mystical Archetype to World of Warcraft Classic+\n\n# A conceptual proposal for how the Monk class can seamlessly integrate into Classic WoW\n\n# I. Introduction — Why the Monk Belongs\n\nThe Monk is a martial, chi-guided warrior whose identity blends physical prowess, spiritual discipline, and elemental harmony. While modern WoW eventually introduced Monks, Classic+ requires a design that feels authentic to 2004’s systems: **resource management, tactical rotations, predictable windows, and meaningful talent choices**.\n\nA Classic+ Monk adds:\n\n* **A unique agility-based tank (Brewmaster)**\n* **A melee-centric DPS (Windwalker)**\n* **A melee-magic hybrid healer (Mistweaver)**\n\nwithout breaking existing class niches or raid balance.\n\n# II. Core Monk Identity\n\n# 1. Stances\n\nMonks specialize in three stances, each defining their resources and playstyle:\n\n* **Tiger Stance** – offensive DPS (Windwalker), uses **Energy**\n* **Ox Stance** – tanking (Brewmaster), uses **Energy**\n* **Serpent Stance** – healing (Mistweaver), uses **Mana**\n\nStances are **off-global cooldown**, allowing smooth tactical shifts without locking players into GCD delays.\n\n# 2. Harmony\n\nHarmony is a unified resource across all stances:\n\n* Generated through key abilities (e.g., Tiger Palm, Spinning Crane Kick, melee hits)\n* Spent differently depending on stance:\n   * Windwalker: finishers for burst damage\n   * Brewmaster: mitigation and self-heals\n   * Mistweaver: empowered casts and fistweaving finishers\n\nHarmony unifies the Monk’s rotational identity while preserving Classic pacing.\n\n# 3. Energy and Resource Flow\n\n* Tiger & Ox stances: Energy-based\n* Serpent stance: Mana-based\n* Hybrid loops allow limited resource feedback (melee attacks restoring a small amount of Mana or Harmony in Mistweaver builds), but remain balanced for Classic raid encounters.\n\n# III. Windwalker Philosophy — Classic Martial Artist\n\nWindwalker is a melee DPS class distinct from Rogues, Warriors, and Enhancement:\n\n* **Short burst windows** anchored by **Fists of Fury**:\n   * 3 rapid strikes totaling \\~150% weapon damage\n   * \\+40–50% attack speed for 8 seconds\n   * Generates 1 Harmony\n* **Harmony-fueled finishers**: Blackout Kick (cleaves via Spinning Crane Kick talent)\n* **Flow State**: provides a Windfury-style buff to party melee (20% chance for one extra attack per swing; Monk only receives a single swing for identity, AP scaling identical to Windfury)\n* Fills a raid niche as a melee-stack enhancement without overshadowing Shamans or Warriors\n\nWindwalker thus combines predictable burst windows, energy management, and party utility—fully compatible with Classic combat pacing.\n\n# IV. Brewmaster Philosophy — The Agility Tank\n\nBrewmasters fill a missing Classic niche:\n\n* Agility-based tank, leather itemization\n* Low-magic, dodge-focused defense\n* Active mitigation through Harmony spenders\n* Melee-threat centric without flat immunity cooldowns\n\nKey mechanics:\n\n* **Ox Stance** increases dodge and stagger-based mitigation\n* **Harmony spenders** grant armor, self-heals, or threat control\n* **Enveloping Strike**: targets an enemy, heals the enemy’s target (typically the tank), integrating with Classic threat mechanics\n\nBrewmasters are rhythmically active, mobile tanks with meaningful decision-making.\n\n# V. Mistweaver Philosophy — Melee-Healer Hybrid\n\nMistweaver introduces a Classic-safe melee-healer archetype:\n\n* Uses **Mana** while in Serpent Stance\n* Can generate small amounts of Harmony through melee for hybrid “fistweaving”\n* Focused on **Renewing Mist, Vivify, and Enveloping Mists** for core healing\n* Healing pulses (**Zen Pulse**) propagate around Renewing Mist targets, rewarding tactical placement rather than blanket healing\n\nMistweaver blends melee activity with casting, giving Classic raids a novel healer role that does not rely on modern smart-healing mechanics.\n\n# VI. Windwalker Talent Tree (Conceptual Overview)\n\n**T1 – Foundation:** Energy cost reduction, early Harmony generation, Tiger Palm damage buffs.  \n**T2 – Mobility & Resource Management:** Movement speed, cooldown reductions, Harmony chance via Pressure Point.  \n**T3 – Identity Tier:** *Flow State* provides Windfury-style party buff; auto-attack damage increases; Pressure Point refinements.  \n**T4 – AoE & Utility:** Spinning Crane Kick synergy, cleave for Blackout Kick, mobility buffs.  \n**T5 – Resource & Crit Tech:** Energy refunds, expertise/crit, FoF attack-speed improvements.  \n**T6 – Finisher Empowerment:** Blackout Kick and Rising Sun Kick damage, cleaving enhancements.  \n**Capstone:** Storm, Earth, and Fire – copies strictly aesthetic / cannot split targets - 20% damage increase\n\n# VII. Conceptual Framework Summary\n\nThe Classic+ Monk delivers:\n\n* **Distinct resource systems:** Energy for Tiger/Ox stances, Mana for Serpent stance\n* **Harmony-based combo rotations**: unifying offense, mitigation, and healing\n* **Burst and rotation windows:** Fists of Fury drives tempo without breaking Classic pacing\n* **Party utility:** Flow State gives Windfury-style benefits without overshadowing Shamans\n* **Hybrid potential:** Mistweavers can fistweave, Brewmasters can self-heal strategically\n* **Tactical engagement:** every stance, talent, and cooldown encourages deliberate, skillful play\n\nThe Monk class adds meaningful choices for Classic+ groups while fully respecting 2004-era mechanics and limitations.\n\nthanks if you read all the way thru - Cheers & prayers for classic+ monk copers","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/1p5zovp/classic_monk_class_pitch/","permalink":"/r/classicwow/comments/1p5zovp/classic_monk_class_pitch/","score":0,"num_comments":7,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764034704.0,"edited":1764035008.0,"link_flair_text":"Classic +","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}
