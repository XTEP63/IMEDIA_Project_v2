{"id":"1p6em4y","name":"t3_1p6em4y","subreddit":"antiwork","author":"TimeAd1111","title":"Loyalty doesn’t pay anymore, so why are people still drinking the Kool-Aid?","selftext":"I genuinely don’t understand how in 2025, people still buy into the idea that if you work hard, stay loyal, and “prove yourself,” a company will reward you with real raises, real promotions, and long-term stability. I’m not saying it never happens, but let’s be honest, the trend has been moving in the opposite direction for decades.\n\nCompanies are running skeleton crews on purpose. They cut payroll, pile more work onto fewer people, squeeze every ounce of productivity out of them, and then cut benefits on top of it all while profits go up. They’re not hiding it. It’s the business model.\n\nWhat makes it even more frustrating is hearing the “nobody wants to work anymore” line. Most of the time, it comes from people 55+ who grew up in a completely different economy. They could buy homes at reasonable prices, get stable full time work with one income, and build something. Today, they can physically walk into a grocery store and see what everything costs, and they know wages haven’t remotely kept pace. The math isn’t complicated. Yet they still default to blaming people work ethic? (Of course not everyone in the 55 and up crowed are like that, but on average it’s usually them.)\n\nWhat I really can’t wrap my head around, though, is when this mentality shows up in people in their 30s and 40s, people who are actively living in the same economic mess as the rest of us. Older millennials lived through the 2008 crash, stagnant wages, insane housing prices, rising medical costs, and corporate greed across every industry. It’s not like they are removed from in and born in a time where right now they have the house and money already? They’re actively living in it getting screwed just as much as people like myself in their 20s.\n\nI’m 29, and even I have moments where I get conflicted. Im a huge advocate of being a quiet quitter, just acting my wage and nothing more, but then I worry, am I screwing myself over? I’ve worked long enough to know that going above and beyond in the past never really got me anywhere. Even if I did get small opportunities, the workload never matched the pay. So I get really conflicted. I want to believe that if you work hard and stay loyal you’ll be rewarded, but then I look around and see everyone getting screwed. So it’s like, no I just go to work do the bare minimum, and get paid for it.\n\nThat’s why I don’t understand how people around my age still drink the kool aid. And honestly it sucks because sometimes it makes me question, am I the idiot by quiet quitting? Like I’m pretty confident I’m not in the wrong but damn people around you can really do a good job at convincing you that you’re a lazy piece of shit that will amount to nothing by not burning yourself out for pennies lmao \n\nEdit: I should mention I’ve been quiet quitting for a couple years now and have felt something is fundamentally wrong with the system since I was probably 14. Growing up I always felt like I was crazy for thinking the way I do about these things but it’s nice to see so many people on here can relate.

You can see my previous posts in my history. This is the latest development and man...I need to find a new job.\n\nSo today was my first day back from an almost three week long medical leave for stress from this job. Noone but me knows that's the reason as the doctor note was vague. I was expecting some flack from my boss on my return and boy, I wasn't let down. Boss sees my this morning and welcomes me back, and asks me how I'm doing. I tell her I'm fine and thank her and the others (who aren't in yet) for covering my work. She then proceeds to say that my leave was badly timed and caused a lot of issues. And I obviously told her it was unexpected but she just reiterates that it was \"really badly timed\" and that I missed a lot of deadlines. Wtf. I just dropped it and didn't respond and sure as hell didn't apologize. Most bosses would at least say \"take your time getting caught up andcome to me if you need any help.\" Not mine apparently.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Normally I do work from home on Tuesdays and she asked if I was coming into the office tomorrow. I had expected her to pull this so I already planned to come in and I told her I was coming in. She proceeded to then tell me good, and that we might need to figure this out since \"being off so long after only being here for six months isn't good for your.....well doesn't look good for....I might be wetting about that but...\" and she was acting as if she wanted to say something but didn't. The underlying 'threats' were clear to me though. I asked her if she was saying I should forego wfh and she immediately said no, she wasn't saying that. Only that she was having a discussion with me on what was best. Because there were a lot of tasks coming up soon that I'd need to be trained on. Now....I've never had a day of training at this job my entire time there. Everything I do, I figured out myself. Because noone in my office knows how to do my job. So I told her that everything that was coming up I already knew how to do. Then I asked her if there was an upcoming task I wasn't aware of. She brushed me off and said she doesn't know what I do or don't know or what my job entails. Wtf again. We were thankfully interrupted and the topic wasn't brought back up.\n\nI just can't with this boss. I don't know what her problem is and I don't know what I've done to get her like this towards me. I need to find anther job but the market is shit but I just had 3 weeks of stress leave and I'm already getting stressed again.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1p5zrih/got_told_my_medical_leave_was_badly_timed/","permalink":"/r/antiwork/comments/1p5zrih/got_told_my_medical_leave_was_badly_timed/","score":81,"num_comments":16,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764034906.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":null,"is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":"self"}

Without naming the business or exactly what I did, lets say it's a Taskrabbit job and it's always the same project so let's say it's putting a bed frame together for people and in the tech field (if that makes sense). This all happened over the weekend.\n\nI told them I've worked in a hospital where I've always assembled medical equipment which includes those beds for patients. They thought it was good enough so I was hired and was to do a project the very next day. I had no trouble with the work itself but it did take me a while because I was so used to putting things together like Ikea products with provided instructions with huge diagrams. In this case, there wasnt much instruction. Not only that but there are different types of bedframes like metal or wood, environmentally safety checks and more things i'm not quite used to. I went through a process with the customer there because they didn't even know I was coming so I couldn't answer questions right away making the whole thing sketchy. I called my boss asking about xyz and he answered fine, didnt seem annoyed. I was still getting to know the whole flow of the job anyways. By the third day, I called less and less about little things and even worked quicker but then I'd run into an obstacle that I'd need tools I didnt think I need so I make trips to a hardware store to buy some, costing time and then I'll look at my google calendar to see that my schedule is completely cleared. \n\nI asked my boss about this and he said, \"You just need a little more experience and being prepared for jobs of this magnitude\".

I waited for his call and he didnt answer back so I left him a text the next day. He seemed annoyed and said he will reach back monday because he's off on weekends. Tuesday (today) came and a different manager called and asked to have their tools and other hardware sent back to them. I didnt ask anything to that manager but I did ask if there's anymore projects i'm doing and he stated, \"don't think so\".\n\nI'm somewhat bummed but even more confused. I told this same boss my level of experience and none of the 'fake it until you make it' exaggeration. I still never heard from him but don't really care at this point. Other co-workers contacted me asking if I bailed work because they had to pick up my projects so they shot themselves in the foot. \n\nAs a former manager in the tech field, I have never heard of a job flow like this getting let go just on my 3rd day.
