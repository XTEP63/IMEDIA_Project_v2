Not only would they know whether to be persuasive or fumble in their roleplay of their case, but you could even give them hints as to what would persuade the other party. Yes, this does dip a bit of insight into persuasion, but I'd argue that reading the person you're convincing is a part of any good attempt at convincing someone.\n\nExample:  \n\"Ok, so you want to convince the villagers that standing and fighting is a better choice than fleeing on the roads. Roll for persuasion.\"  \n\"23.\"  \n\"Wow, ok, so, give a speech that convinces the villagers. You know that the roads aren't safe, which might convince them, but you also notice that they seem reluctant to give up their village to the encroaching monsters. Their homes for generations. That might also be an angle you can work.\"  \n\"Alright. \\*Ahem.\\* People of Remoteville, I know you are scared, I know this is something you never encountered, but if you run from the shuffling undead now, they will destroy your village and everything it has ever been. Bring your children and your elderly to the barn in the center, but help us barricade the roads and together, we will help your home withstand this evil.\"\n\n  \n\"Ok, so you want to convince the villagers that standing and fighting is a better choice than fleeing on the roads. Roll for persuasion.\"  \n\"Ehm... 8.\"  \n\"Ouf. Okay, so, describe how you try to convince them, but they end up fleeing the village anyway. They won't listen to a purely logical approach, they're afraid and don't have the patience for long speeches.\"  \n\"Alright, errrr... my character steps up onto a box and goes: People of Remoteville, the roads aren't save! You need to stay here, with us, and fight the undead! You can grab a... er... pitchfork or something. It's not an ideal weapon, I guess, but the road is way more dangerous! Stay with us and defend the village!\"   \n\"Alright, great, they barely listen to you as they hastily pack up their things and prepare to hit the road.\"  \n\"Uch.

{"id":"1p655xx","name":"t3_1p655xx","subreddit":"DnD","author":"TvujMilacek","title":"People in our group are not taking notes","selftext":"Hello everybody. I think I just need to let this out.  \nI am the only person in our group that writes stuff down. From important NPCs, monster resistances, to simple what to do and where to go. Others don't do that. That creates problems when I get to a point that (for whatever reason) I stop. Sometimes I'm just exhausted during 7/9 hours long session. Or sometimes its simply impossible write every single thing. On top of that I also manage all the crafting, scroll writing, potion making and group inventory. Sometimes it feels ridiculous for me to say stuff like \"Dude, you just bought 3 potions, write that in your sheet!\"  \nLast session was a prime example. \"So what do you do next?\" asks the DM. Group stares at him, \"We don't know?\". \"What do you mean? You got the clues last time, you are able to solve this. Did you write it down?\" and now everybody is looking at me. I start flicking through my journal, reading everything, but for some reason, this info is not there. Our wizard than says \"I have it written here! I wrote a name!\" Yes, a name. Only a name and nothing else. Great. We were lucky that DM let us roll if we can remember, so we were able to continue. Because apart from a name, we were supposed to know where to go and how to get there.  \nI keep telling them that they need to fill in, especially when they see that I'm not writing things down or when I'm not well (I was very sick recently and It took its toll on me), but this lasts only for like 10 minutes. My journal is almost full, but their notebooks can be easily reused in next adventure.  \nToday I told the DM: \"Please, next time the group doesn't know, please, make us go back and do it again, otherwise they will never start writing stuff\". He agreed, because he is angry as well and he even said it makes him feel like they don't appreciate his work. It also gets annoying when we are fighting a monster we met before and they ask \"Can I roll for what do I know about Minotaurs?\" - \"No, you fought them before, so you know enough already\" DM gets frustrated because these questions are slowing the game down.  \nThank you for your time reading this, I would appreciate your suggestions.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p655xx/people_in_our_group_are_not_taking_notes/","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p655xx/people_in_our_group_are_not_taking_notes/","score":341,"num_comments":204,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764051520.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Table Disputes","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
{"id":"1p6at1s","name":"t3_1p6at1s","subreddit":"DnD","author":"CivilAd3631","title":"My DM screwed up and set me up in front of another player (part 2)","selftext":"I'd like to share how our previous session went, because everything about that was a quintessence of what I like in DND. And I'll say upfront that the session was wonderful.\n\nTLDR of my previous post: I joined the guys playing the Dungeon of Drakkenheim, and the DM overlooked the fact that my character's backstory (the lost heir to the throne) overlapped with another player, D, which upset D because it jeopardized his character's storyline.\n\nSince there have been a lot of repeated questions and comments, I'll clarify a few points:\n\n1. In this module, players choose from among the backstories offered. The lost heir is one of them, and more than one player can choose it. So, none of us have main character syndrome, lol. We just chose what seemed interesting.\n\n2. I didn't join the game from the beginning, so session 0 didn't happen for me. I don't know if you guys do a session 0 for every new player. I've never had that experience.\n\n3. Also, according to the plot of this module, 15 years ago, many people turned into monsters, and as the players progress, among other things, they find a way to return these monsters to human form. Basically, my character was turned into a monster as a child. 15 years later, a group of players find her, recognize her resemblance to the lost princess, and turn her back into a human. My character has an unstable, childish mind and a teenage body. So, you understand that from the very beginning (and this was conceived even before the incident with D), my character wasn't a convincing candidate for the throne, lol.\n\n4. We ended the previous session with the players defeating me as a monster and recognizing me as the princess.\n\nSo, despite everyone advising me to talk to D beforehand, I decided not to. I figured that since he'd chosen the DM as the liaison between us, I'd respect that for now and not bother D personally. Despite the DM's mistake, I consider him a generally good and competent person who can resolve such matters between players.\n\nSo, I confirmed to the DM that my character wasn't planning to claim the throne, and we'd emphasize my character's childishness and obvious unpreparedness for such matters in my roleplaying.\n\nSo, we started the session with the players defeating me, the monster. D immediately started acting like I was someone very dear to him. He barked at all the NPCs who doubted the monster should be turned back into human, lol.\n\nWhen the transformation ended, he watched like a hawk to make sure I was given every possible care and attention, and, no longer hiding it, he called me cousin, to the gaping mouths of the other players and NPCs.\n\nWhen my character woke up, we had what I dare to call a cinematic roleplay of the reunion of two cousins. He carefully and kindly told me his real name, not the one the other players knew him by, so that my character would recognize him as someone from her past. He then talked to my character (who, mind you, is almost a child), trying to understand what I remember, how I survived monstrification, and so on. I shared a lot of lore information that we'd agreed on with the DM beforehand. At the end of the session, the other players all said the scene was really cool, and they listened to us with great interest.\n\nBasically, D and I began a dynamic relationship where he's the grown cousin, a kind older brother (and he basically behaves like a knight with everyone in the game), and I'm the younger sister who will happily rely on him.\n\nAlso, in a conversation with one high-ranking NPC, I clearly stated as part of the roleplay that I wouldn't lay claim to the throne, I wanted it to be said by me at the table.\n\nOverall, our session ended on a good note, and I think the misunderstanding can be considered resolved.\n\nI think your advice to talk to D directly is actually good, and it's exactly what should be done in most cases where misunderstandings and hurt feelings arise. The fact that we resolved things without that was probably a bit of luck (D and I were mutually committed to having fun, not creating drama) and the result of our DM's efforts, who corrected his mistake by serving as a bridge between us.\n\nThank you all, and have great games.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p6at1s/my_dm_screwed_up_and_set_me_up_in_front_of/","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p6at1s/my_dm_screwed_up_and_set_me_up_in_front_of/","score":284,"num_comments":13,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764072560.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Table Disputes","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

{"id":"1p6itpa","name":"t3_1p6itpa","subreddit":"DnD","author":"its_about_the_cones_","title":"Am I ruining another players fun, or just maintaining the ‘spirit of the game’?","selftext":"Background:\n\nThe whole cast:\nDM,\nDruid,\nMe,\nPaladin,\nCleric,\nRogue\n\nI play in a relatively new game (half a year weekly now) with my friend DM. DM and I met as adults but everyone else in the game are friends he grew up with (plus his brother, DRUID) \n\nPaladin, cleric and rogue are new to DND but were introduced via BG3 and wanted to give it a try. DM added Druid and me and we had a group. \n\nIt is also worth mentioning that Druid and I are both a bit of a rules lawyer, but seem to have very similar views on the subject and know that the DM has final say. My catchphrase is “well the rule is …. But it’s up to the DM”\nI am also aware that this is annoying and I try not to chime in very often, usually just when the DM asks the table about a rule, or when another player seems confused about something. Druid chimes in a little bit more than me (but he’s usually always right). \n\nThe story: \nThe game has been good over the past half year or so. One thing that happens repeatedly is, Paladin (who played a lot of BG3) often uses BG3 rules instead of 5e ones. He will push as a bonus action without the feat, use water for bonus damage, jump at the start of his turn to extend his speed, throw potions to heal people, say the rogue has two bonus actions, and has spiritual weapon act as its own character in combat instead of a bonus action and some more that I can’t remember at this point.  I will let most of these go, unless it would create a significant change for the situation we’re in or if it creates confusion at the table. \n\nOur DM has also played a lot of BG3 and sometimes gets confused which rule is a BG3 rule and which one is a 5e rule. This is usually where Druid and I will step in and try to help with the confusion, but say it’s up to the DM to decide. DM seems to want to run it as close to written 5e rules as possible, leaving some room for cool. \n\nThis came to ahead at last weeks session when we were checking out some loot and found  Gauntlets of Ogre power (increase wearers strength score to 19). \n\nThe paraphrased conversation went like this:\n\nPaladin: oh these will be great for me\n\nMe: well isn’t your strength already 20. I think they would be good for Cleric (life cleric with high WIS and CON and often finds himself on front lines)\n\nPaladin: yeah but I could respec and swap my strength and charisma, or just put my 8 as my strength stat and use the gloves\n\nMe: Respec? What do you mean, how would you do that? \n\nPaladin: *looking at the DM* I can respec right?\n\nDM looked like he didn’t know what to do, so he ended the session shortly after that and said that he would figure it out later.  As people were leaving DM’s house I lingered behind until I was the last one there. I remember what I said to him before I left because I have no idea why I used this phrasing, but I said, “I don’t think you should let him respec, it’s against the spirit of the game” (again don’t know why I said it like that).\n\nHe said the didn’t know what he was gonna decide and we left it at that and I went home. \n\nNow I seek your judgement r/dnd, am I just crushing another players fun with my rules lawyering, or was I in the right to say something?\n\nEven though I typed this whole thing up I don’t think it’s quite a hill I’m willing to die on, and will keep playing with the group if DM lets Paladin respec. I would just feel bad for cleric.

How do you roll them at your table?","selftext":"One of my players and I were visiting the other night and realized that, in our experience, crit damage is far and away the most home-ruled part of the game. We've played at more tables that ignored RAW than used it! Naturally I thought I'd ask y'all what you do.\n\nUsing the saddest possible example: rolling ones with a greatsword as a lvl 1 fighter, STR +3, I've played at tables that used:\n\nRAW - 1+1+1+1+3 = 7\n\nDouble the dice result + mod - (1+1)*2+3 = 7\n\nDouble the total damage - (1+1+3)*2 = 10\n\nOur table's current rule, max dice + roll dice + mod - 1+1+6+6+3 = 17\n\nAnd others! Now, I'm no math wiz, but IIRC our table rule produces the highest average and lowest spread, and we like it a lot because it keeps garbage rolls on damage from taking the \"oomph\" out of your crits. It's not 100% a cinematic \"MAX DAMAGE\" crit, nor is it 100% up to the randomness of the dice. Crits should be a big deal, in our view\n\nSo, do you have a table rule? If so, why do you like it?\n\nAnd of course, since this is a critpost, give me your favorite crit stories!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p6fk56/lets_talk_crits_how_do_you_roll_them_at_your_table/","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p6fk56/lets_talk_crits_how_do_you_roll_them_at_your_table/","score":47,"num_comments":157,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764084973.0,"edited":1764088247.0,"link_flair_text":"5th Edition","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
{"id":"1p6dqro","name":"t3_1p6dqro","subreddit":"DnD","author":"ZiggyRumbuckle","title":"Ran a Christmas one-shot that I was very proud of","selftext":"This is partially to brag but mainly to vent enthusiasm for a Christmas one-shot I DM’d recently. I mainly run Strahd for this group, so the goal was something silly and rules-lite as a pallet cleanser. The main parts are as follows:\n\n- Players were tasked with creating Level 6, 5e characters to replicate any character from any Christmas movie or story. The result: Jack Skellington, the Grinch, John McClane, Callum Drift, the Yule Cat, and A Partridge in a Pear Tree.\n\n- Santa has been kidnapped! Specifically the Santa of Faerun’s planet. He is an archfey so powerful that his magic seeps into other universes and planes, thus creating Santa’s elsewhere. In desperation to find him, an artifact is used to cast Wish summoning people who can save Santa.\n\n- The party can track Santa to the South Pole, Krampus’s lair. It is an unstable place of variable appearance and properties. It is also where certain evil things and creatures are sealed.\n\n- Teleporting in, the group navigate a snowstorm before finding a two story, red brick, Georgian style home. To spare the details, the players run a Home Alone encounter to a portal, dance with the Nutcracker against the Rat King, and sled downhill to an ice cavern.\n\n- In the cave’s walls, objects and people are sealed behind ice and runes. Evil Christmas things: a Mogwai, Mr. Potter, Robot Santa from Futurama, etc. The cave opens to a large ice cavern with a giant rune on one wall and two figures in front of it: an unconscious Santa, and his captor, Tim Allen from The Santa Clause.\n\n- Tim Allen Santa wishes to expand Christmas using the power of an ancient sealed being. “But it’s too late! I finished the ritual hours ago. Listen….she’s here…”\n\n- Needle drop “All I Want for Christmas is You” as a 10’ tall Mariah Carey bursts from the seal. Boasting the stats of a dialed down Lesser Star Spawn Emissary, it made for a great fight.\n\nIn addition to the joke landing, the battle itself was a fun climax to the adventure that felt balanced but tense. It was a super fun one-shot to run and I couldn’t have done it without an amazing group of players to join in. It’ll be a core memory of my DnD career.\n\nThat’s all! Happy to provide any details if requested.\n\nP.S.

She looks sad and lonely if they keep going. (She's not a witch she's just old and ugly, if they fight her obviously she isn't much for combat)\n\n2. The party comes across a small stream or creek in the woods, think ten feet wide and shallow. There is a small newly built bridge spanning the creek. A huge haughty troll comes out laughing at the party and demanding they pay a toll to use his bridge, obviously proud of his new business shaking down travellers. Here it is up to the party to realize they can just walk across the stream at any other point if they don't want to pay or fight him (I use this on low level parties that probably can't beat a troll). If they do this I have him be very disappointed, telling them he owns the land a hundred yards up and down stream, before realizing this is also not a difficulty to just bypass. \n\nDo you have any gimmicks like this I can steal for my games?\n\n","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p6gvpo/dnd_gimmicks_you_pull_as_dm/","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p6gvpo/dnd_gimmicks_you_pull_as_dm/","score":35,"num_comments":40,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764087915.0,"edited":1764092422.0,"link_flair_text":"DMing","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Space is of course a constraint, and I want to keep this as a general character sheet, so not features that are only necessary for one class.\n* I dislike that all trackers have to specify the max, but the sheet should be usable both digitally and printed, so having e.g. dashed boxes that you trace with a pen to indicate the max isn't possible. Any clever solutions that would get rid of the max field for each tracker would be nice.\n* If you use the sheet in play, let me know anything that's confusing or causes friction.\n\nCheers!","url":"https://i.redd.it/uacxrl7cif3g1.png","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p6h7wk/oc_improved_fillable_character_sheet_for_5e_1424/","score":31,"num_comments":9,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764088676.0,"edited":1764096133.0,"link_flair_text":"5.5 Edition","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

In my case, I love sharing the stage with my fellow players and will gladly take a back seat when it’s their time to shine. I love hearing and watching stories almost as much as I like telling them.\n\nWhat I’m referring to is being the main character in terms of a plot. I often build my characters to be interesting in the long run, so I tie their stories and motivations to larger world issues and try to humanize them as much as I can. I also constantly develop my characters, and write stories and dreams and nightmares and send them to my DM so we have more material to work with.\n\nOur last campaign (which was our second ever) ended up getting a soft reboot and since I was the only one carrying over their pre-reboot character, the story naturally started around my PC. Problem is, the other players never really figured out their backstories, so the entirety of the campaign naturally evolved to being around my PC.\n\nThis wasn’t a bad thing at the time. We all have great memories from that campaign, the story was epic as hell, and most importantly we all had fun.\n\nWe’re now in our third campaign, it’s slightly longer form, and the same thing has happened. For context, I was thinking of temporarily changing characters for two main reasons: 1. In our current party’s situation, it narratively really doesn’t make much sense for my character to remain with the party, at least for the time being. 2. I wanted to play a simpler character that will allow me to take a step back and give my fellow players the chance to develop their own stories and explore the plot books the DM laid out for them. \n\nIt turns out that pretty much everyone in the campaign is now thinking of switching characters, since according to my DM, they think my PC leaving leaves them without much to do, which I disagree with but that’s just me. And it also means we’ll have to sort of reboot, again, and that doesn’t sound very appealing to me.\n\nAnd I guess this hits the core of the issue - what if my PC died? Would the campaign just come to a halt? \n\nI’ll be bringing this up in our next session, but this situation really has me wondering if I did something wrong somehow. We’re basically falling into the exact situation I’m trying to avoid.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p6in9s/is_being_the_main_character_of_a_campaign_a_bad/","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p6in9s/is_being_the_main_character_of_a_campaign_a_bad/","score":9,"num_comments":54,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764091812.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"5th Edition","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

{"id":"1p6ro17","name":"t3_1p6ro17","subreddit":"DnD","author":"LieEnvironmental5207","title":"New Eberron Dragonmark Feats","selftext":"Just wanting to have a blah about the new Dragonmark Feats - which ones I think will provide interesting interactions in games where they can be used. These are based on my own interests but I’m curious to see everyone elses.\n\nFirstly - all spells that are added via these expanded spell lists count as spells for your main spellcasting class - meaning that (as far as i’m aware) these work with features like the new Artificer Spell Storing Item, the Sorcerer’s Innate Sorcery, etc.\n\n1. Mark of Handling.\nThe base features are okay - definitely fun for me since i love making characters that can connect with animals. But the real interest for me is adding both Command and Find Familiar to a class spell list - arguably the 2 strongest 1st level spells in the game depending on your table. The rest of the spells dont stand out nearly as much, but I think that in low level campaigns with animals in them could be great.\nThe monstrous connection could be neat too in niche situations.\n\n2. Mark of Healing\nWizards and Divine Soul enjoyers rejoice - healing spells for all. Just a good option all around in smaller parties where you might not want to risk just having the 1 healer. Wizards can party finally being able to heal - giving them without a doubt the best spell list in the game.\nBut most importantly, IMO, it gives Prayer of Healing. Free short rest in just 10 minutes!\n\n3. Mark of Hospitality\nSimilar to Healing, this feat gives great support and utility options. The spell options (not the free casting ones, those are just ok) are great. Goodberry, Sleep, Aid, Enhance Ability, Leomund’s Tiny Hut. Amazing options across the board.\n\n4. Mark of Passage.\n+5 ft of movement never hurts, and the spell list is also great imo. Find steed? Fantastic. Phantom Steed? Even better in certain situations. Dimension door is great too - and of course Misty Step for free once per day is fine. Almost every class, subclass, and species has a teleport now, but one more never hurts.\n\n5. Mark of Storm.\nSkipping all the other stuff that makes this great - it lets sorcerers get Conjure Minor Elementals. Im almost 100% certain this will lead to crazy blaster builds that are stronger than most others, due to metamagic and innate sorcery.\nThe rest of the features are great though as well - resistance to lightning damage and the rest of the spell list being useful at worse is great.\n\n6. Greater mark of finding - Not happy with this one. Here was yet another opportunity to make hunters mark not cost concentration anymore, and they still didnt take it. Bleh.\n\n7. Greater mark of healing - even more healing per long rest. Not bad. not great, but useful.\n\n8. Greater mark of Hospitality - once per long rest removing a layer of Exhaustion is so niche its crazy - but with one of the DM’s i play with, it will be insanely good.\n\n9. Greater Mark of Storm - Gaining access to a 60 foot fly speed (for a short duration and only once per day, but still) at level 4 is nice. Sorcerers make it even better with extended spell, so thats cool.\n\n10. Potent Dragonmark - Amazing, amazing amazing feat. Preparing all of the spells on the list is just great, especially with the options listed above. Artificers, Rangers, Sorcerers and wizards gain the most benefit from this imo.\n\nThats all. Thank you!","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p6ro17/new_eberron_dragonmark_feats/","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p6ro17/new_eberron_dragonmark_feats/","score":4,"num_comments":3,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764112328.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"5.5 Edition","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

Marvin is only 17 years old, but since the age of 10, after a tragic event in which he lost his father and one of his eyes in a fight against a sea monster, he has been forced to train to help the people he loves overcome the threats brought by darkness. Marvin ventured into the deep oceans, where he was received by spiritual beings such as fairies and elementals, who granted him knowledge of the powers of nature and water. Through deep meditation and arduous training, these powers connect the mortal to the transcendental, thus making Marvin a herald of the divine, a herald of balance. Marvin received the mark of his divinity in a magical pearl, which serves as his eye and also as a source of power. It was forged inside a large mystical oyster and grants Marvin power over the weather, from controlling the flow of rivers and currents to creating a storm across miles.","url":"https://i.redd.it/bhmljncruc3g1.png","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p66918/oc_marvin_lazuline_the_the_paladin_of_the_storm/","score":3,"num_comments":0,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764055524.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Art","is_self":false,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

I think we have a good rapport and have a similar style of RP'ing (third person mostly), and our DM is a long time friend who is pretty great at it.  However....\n\nI get the feeling that he is getting quite exasperated at our inability to do the following:\n\n* Ask the right questions of NPCs.\n* Pick up cues from the environment, NPCs or dialogue.\n* Collaboratively push the story forward through our characters, rather than him have to railroad things to keep the story progressing.\n\nSpeaking personally, I find it quite hard to parse what the important 'bits' of a conversation are and worry about slowing our whole session down to a crawl with essentially a list of everything I can think of relating to the NPC and what they've said.   This also applies to story cues in the environment - I find it hard to know what I can discard as fluff, and what is a potential plot device or story hook.   I'm also terrible at piecing together strands of information in order to understand the story so far, though this is not just a D&D thing; I'm dreadful at keeping up with plots in other media.   I've not asked my fellow players if they feel the same on the above points, but in private conversations with my DM I get the impression it's a similar story.\n\nWe're approaching the end of our current campaign and our next is going to be some kind of murder mystery, at least initially.

Two players are sharing one character kinda like Jekyll and Hyde. There's a Totem Barbarian, a Great old One Warlock, an Assassin Rogue and a Fiend Warlock(Jekyll and Hyde players.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n>!I’m building a major dystopian city called Avermere for my Campaign. It has layered social structure, an active dragon-worshipping cult, nobles powering the city by draining an ancient dragon, and a rebellion in the middle of it all. I’d love feedback on whether the city feels strong, coherent, exciting for players, or if anything feels weak, underdeveloped, or confusing.!<\n\n**Main Topic: (Big read, sorry)**  \nHey everyone, I’m building a major dystopian city called Avermere for my D&D campaign. I'm taking a little inspiration from We Happy Few, Dishonoured and BG3 for some of the overall vibe, and I’d love some outside eyes on it. My players are going to spend a big part of the campaign here and I want the factions, encounters, and especially the city its self to feel compelling and playable.\n\n**Premise:**\n\nThe city itself is built as three ringed layers, similar to Attack on Titan and is very mechanical and industrial (Lots of lightning and tesla stuff)\n\n* The Outer Layer is poverty-stricken and almost entirely controlled by a cult that worships a shapeshifting dragon. They shake down civilians for “protection,” enforce a curfew at night, and are openly warring with the nobles of the city. It's the kind of vibe where Scrying orbs float around constantly and people are terrified to stand out in any way.\n* The Middle Layer is contested territory. Both the nobles and the cult are fighting for dominance here, but there is also a rebellion that's stationed here, trying to fight back against both sides. The rebellion’s HQ is hidden and will hopefully be a safe haven for the players (if they side with them).\n* The Inner Layer is home to the nobles who control the entire city by secretly draining the life-force of an ancient dragon Demi-God to power everything in their city. This dragon isn’t the same one that the cult worships. The cultists are trying to kill the noble’s dragon so their own dragon god can replace it as the ruler of Avermere.\n\n(A lot of this info is of course secret to the players at first)\n\nA very important part of the city is that there's basically no freedom anywhere. Citizens have these magical items (Not sure what kind yet, whether its cards or coins or whatever) that are used to identify them (Like real life IDs). You need these items to get through checkpoints throughout the city as well as buying things and using the trains. Outsiders can also get these items when visiting this city. I want something like this to be available to the party so that they have the option to either Take the item and be able to get through the city easier, but the enemy would know where they are. or not use them to protect their location but have a harder time getting around and doing things.\n\nI'm going to have the party split between infiltration(roleplay) and operation (combat). My group likes dividing tasks, so I’m trying to design a city where the players that wanna roleplay more can infiltrate the noble courts, dig up secrets, and navigate the political schemes. The more combat-heavy players raid cult hideouts, sentinel factories, ritual sites, etc. Ideally, both sides help each other get further in the plot. The intel from the role-players will give info that the fighters can use mess things up. And the fighters will open up areas and take out specific enemies that make it easier for the infiltrators to get around and get more information.\n\nA big physical part of the city is its railway system. Trains attach to the top and bottom of these elevated tracks. Your class status is what dictates whether you ride on the top train or the bottom train. Each train car can also decouple mid-route to redirect to different stations where they reconnect to let everyone off. There are also these enforcer trains which are armoured and loaded with soldiers and Tesla cannons which is deployed when people do things that would get them to like five stars in GTA. They can also tether fleeing passenger cars and reel them back in.\n\nThe specialized railway soldiers are trained specifically to fight on these moving trains. They use magnetized runes on their boots to stick to the tops or undersides of speeding cars, grappling hooks to possibly recover if thrown off and they use a multipurpose spear that fires arcane bolts and can shoot its spear head to impale targets and reel them in (Catch over kill kinda thing).\n\nThe city also uses mass-produced elixirs sold everywhere as medication for lung-smog build-up. Mechanically they’re used like healing potions for the party to use, but in-lore they’re practically a government-mandated survival item because of all the pollution. They can be found in stores all over the place as well as little phone-booth like dispensers that they can buy them from.\n\nEverything (hopefully) will build toward a huge climax where the rebellion, with the help of the players, attempt to free the dragon the nobles have been draining. The cult will also unleash their dragon god and the players will end up fighting the cult leader while the two dragons battle in the background. I'm going to use the dragons as environmental things that'll happen mid combat.\n\nSo does Avermere work and is it missing anything or do you guys have any ideas that could make it better? Does it sound like it could be fun and interesting for the players or overcrowded? Are there potential pitfalls or plot holes that I’m not seeing? \n\nAny advice, critique, or refinement would really help before I lock Avermere in for the campaign.","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p68ps8/looking_for_feedback_on_my_kingdom_what_could_i/","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p68ps8/looking_for_feedback_on_my_kingdom_what_could_i/","score":2,"num_comments":19,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764065136.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"DMing","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}

What I have done so far.","selftext":"(Map was created using Inkarnate. This is just a 2k version of the map, the 4k version was too big for Reddit.)\n\nDyer Kryf is one of the five major kingdom's that make up the continent of Prydara. It used to belong to the Dyer Empire before it's collapse almost 700 years ago from the aftermath of the Great Incursion. During which, the God-Titan Pylon struck down the Demo-Titan Tharizda in the heart of the region. After his defeat, the corpse of Tharizda began to decay. As it did, the demonic energies of the Abyss melded with the magic of creation that all titans have innately, and from this union, legions of monsters and aberrations began pouring out of the titan's corpse, infesting the region around it for hundred of miles, rendering the region practically uninhabitable to people due to how dangerous these monsters were.\n\nA decade later, the Avatar of stone, Horus Wright, arrived at the valley with the intent on putting a stop to monsters that poured out from it. Using his natural connection to stone as an Avatar, he began molding the earth around the valley into a large massive wall, erected to contain the monsters within the valley and prevent their unchecked spread throughout the region. It took him over ten years to finish his great project and fully surround the valley with massive stone walls that formed from mountain roots and reached up to three thousand feet in the air when measured from the base of the mountains. Not long after, people from all over the continent began to hear tales about the man on the wall who fought back against the monsters in Tharizda's Valley, and many decided to go join him. Horus and those who joined him became a faction known as the Helweir, and over the past seven hundred years they have stood atop the wall, unbroken and unshaken.\n\nTharizda's corpse finished decaying almost two hundred years ago, and ever since the need for the Helweir has begun to decline. The world has begun to move towards a more modern one. People's understanding of their world has dramatically increased through the recent enlightenment, and the world is seeing a golden age of science and innovation. But the old world hasn't died yet, and the wilderness is still full of monsters waiting and hiding in the shadows. But fortunately the people of Dyer Kryf still have the Helweir to look to for help. Today they are known as the largest and most successful guild of monster hunters in the world, and their services are still in high demand.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis map is what I currently have done but I may end up adding more details to it at some point later. Over 200 hours have been poured into it so far, mostly because I just like world building and making maps in my spare time. This one has become my biggest obsession though thus far, due to my love for the world that I've created. The map features dozens of major cities and locations; with each one I attempted to use a unique icon and decorate the region surrounding them with little Easter eggs that relate to possible encounters and story moments I have planned for the campaign. Plus just a variety of extra locations that I'm not planning on really using in the campaign, but included to help bring the world to life.\n\n  \nAlso, the locations on the map aren't to scale with how big the kingdom actually is. The size of all icons are exaggerated to allow for the unique details of each location. In my mind, this is supposed to be a map that was painted within the world by a famous artist and currently hangs in the Pledge Hall of the Helweir in their citadel. In reality there's so much more in between each location, but not everything can be included on such a large and important map.

{"id":"1p66nok","name":"t3_1p66nok","subreddit":"DnD","author":"Prince-of_Space","title":"I just wanna gush about my character, my DM and campaign a bit - Long post!!!","selftext":"I've been friends with my DM for a good 5, 6 years now, and we're pretty close, but I'm really wanting to talk about how much he means to me as a friend and a DM. \n\nThis is his first time DMing and its so engaging. He has pretty strong 'tism that really lends itself to creative projects and worldbuilding, as he's been showing during this campaign. \n\nThe character I'm playing is an aasimar warlock who has one of the biggest character flaw I could give to a character - he's a 17 year old. Larluniel Xim, nickname, Lary. Grew up being groomed as the next head of a diplomatic estate of aasimar who are basically seen as this region's guardian angels - they don't rule anything, but they're exceedingly powerful diplomats and ambassadors to the surrounding elven, human and dwarven cities in the area. \n\nHowever, after seeing a visiting diplomat nearly kill one of their servants when they thought they weren't being watched, and hearing the diplomat say, \"He's just a servant, he's expendable\", Lary formed a connection is his 15-year-old brain of servants are expendable -> aasimar are the servants of the gods -> I'm expendable, and that fucked with him. Ran away from home, pacted with a fiend to intentionally fall, and traveled the countryside. \n\nHis pact with this devil, Abaddon, was along the lines of \"Fuck with people in power and get them to sign their lives away to Abaddon\" which Lary did with absolute glee, because he was disillusioned with the idea of people in power, even good people in power, having any and all control over the little people. So much so that he absolutely refuses to use any kind of magic that exerts control over another - Suggestion and Command have never been touched once in this entire campaign. \n\nThe campaign takes place on an archipelago off the mainland continent that has 22 gods based on the Arcana Major of tarot, and is a safe haven from the pantheon on the mainland, so people come here to flee their previous lives, so that was perfect for Lary. \n\nAt first, I had no idea what I wanted to do with Lary. He was just a little shithead fucker who hated people in power with a passion and would do everything he could to oppose them - to the point of getting cursed by the Magician God of the islands. But slowly I worked with my DM to come up with some ideas as to where I want Lary to go. \n\nAt first I was fine with Lary either getting put into a position of needing to break his pact with Abaddon or continue being his flunky - I was happy to let the narrative play out. But after some character growth involving reconnecting with his deva great great great great grandmother and accepting his aasimar heritage, awakening his Divine Soul Sorcery multiclass, my DM and I have basically agreed that its not a case of IF Lary breaks his pact, but WHEN. Lary is a shithead 17 year old who wants to help people, but he does so in the typical 17 year old rebellious way, but he's slowly coming to terms with that, and there will most definitely be a time where Abaddon will ask too much of Lary and he'll rebel against him as well. \n\nI've been trying to think of what I'll do after I break pact. My DM has said that he doesn't like the idea of me pacting to my ggggrandmother deva to become a celestial warlock; I could just 1-to-1 my levels into my Sorcerer levels, but that feels bland given we have another Sorcerer on the table; I have been using a custom Pact of the Tome invocation that makes it function like a wizard's spellbook so I could become a Wizard/Sorc multiclass... I was thinking about potentially becoming an arcane warlock pacted to the Magician God who cursed Lary as a part of character growth, but that God has really put his backing behind our Sorcerer and I don't want to take that PC-NPC relationship away from them. \n\nBut it seems like I've been worry for naught. I think my DM has a plan, and potentially a homebrew Warlock subclass in store for me. See, an NPC who was traveling with the party since we got to the islands gave Lary a latticework orb with a pink flame in the center of it. Lary, being extremely curious by nature and a bit of a nerd given his upbringing, immediately started fiddling with it - and tried to Identify it, only to be met with resistance and took 23 unresisted Psychic damage on a successful retreat from the Identify. All I found out was this item was legendary artifact tier. \n\nAfter some more testing and science, including figuring out that it would absorb certain elements of magic and reflect others, I finally decided to try to attune to it - only to be pulled into the orb mentally, and met three beings inside it, a hooded warlock, an archfey and an ifrit prince. Long story short, Lary gave the right answers to these three and was able to successfully attune to the latticework orb, gaining a new warlock pact magic spellslot in the process. \n\nIt wasn't until last session that something clicked for me though. We're in the Halls of Temptation, ruled over by the Infernal Goddess of Temptation, who has split the party and given each of us offerings of desire - if we accept the desire, then we get a debuff, but that becomes available for the Goddess to grant if we make it to the end; if we deny the desire, no debuff, but we have to fight the manifestation that offered the desire (our Sorcerer had to fight himself, for example). \n\nThe party was split into 3 groups, determined by dice rolls - one of our party with two of our NPCs, two of our party with one of our NPCs, and Lary on his lonesome. Lary accepted the first desire, which was to help remove the demon that was grafted to one of our NPCs, which was, for all intents and purposes, Lary's fault, so he feels great responsibility for it. When the Goddess shows up in front of him and offers him to join up with one group or the other, he goes \"Nah, I'll get to the end first and help my friend, I'll go solo\". \n\nThis interested the Goddess, and so Lary's next room wasn't an offered desire, but an offer of temptation - Lary was face to face with himself, next to his ggggrandmother and Abaddon at his sides, dead. The manifestation said he could be so much more powerful if he broke his chains, the chains of his heritage and the chains of his pact, to which Lary vehemently denied, so the whole party got summoned to him and the Manifestation of Temptation attacked - while summoning the warlock, the archfey and the ifrit prince as its own allies, and still used Lary's current warlock spells. \n\nThats when it clicked for me - my DM is setting me up to making a pact with the magic of the orb, which the warlock inside told me was created during the Age of the Gods as an almighty power source. I haven't said anything to him, I want to see where this goes, but my god, I love my DM so much. He cares about the world and the characters so much and I can't wait to see what he has in store for all of us.

{"id":"1p6sxoo","name":"t3_1p6sxoo","subreddit":"DnD","author":"_unrulynotunloved_","title":"Frustration with fellow player","selftext":"So I’m in a campaign with a seasoned DM, me and my husband (fairly well adept players) and a few friends who are new to it entirely. Our one friend (let’s call him X) is very in the mindset of needing to be the edgelord in every situation he’s in and he’s instilled this into his character as well. X amplifies his edginess in his character to a point where he’s ruined a few encounters for the simple fact of “well my character doesn’t care for your character so he won’t react” or simply refusing to react with the party in those obvious plot choices that our DM has set for us to further our quests. He continues to claim that it’s within his character’s right to be stand-off and uncaring but he’s practically playing a character that wouldn’t have joined our party and was forced into it. We’ve made attempts in game to resolve some issues with the character and get closer but X continues to retaliate and then when confronted outside the game just gives the excuse of character playing “just too well” and that our characters aren’t beneficial to him. I’ve brought this up to my husband who’s equally frustrated and even the DM who’s been trying to set up encounters to prompt X into becoming more open with the party and it keeps getting shut down. Any suggestions before I lose my mind or my friend over something so trivial?","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/1p6sxoo/frustration_with_fellow_player/","permalink":"/r/DnD/comments/1p6sxoo/frustration_with_fellow_player/","score":0,"num_comments":14,"over_18":false,"stickied":false,"created_utc":1764115633.0,"edited":0.0,"link_flair_text":"Table Disputes","is_self":true,"spoiler":false,"locked":false,"thumbnail":""}
