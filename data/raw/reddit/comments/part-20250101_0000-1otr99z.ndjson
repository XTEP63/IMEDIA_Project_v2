Up until the very end I thought this would be a 1 or 2 star, but then I found myself in tears at the end and unable to stop thinking about it. It takes a lot of skill to get that much out of such sparse prose, so I totally see why it appealed to the judges.","created_utc":1762812433.0,"parent_id":"t3_1otr99z","link_id":"t3_1otr99z","score":131,"is_submitter":false}

{"comment_id":"no9rnd5","post_id":"1otr99z","author":"sferis_catus","body":"> it was one of my least favorite reads this year.\n\nI'm in the same boat, I found Flesh to be a very weak offering. Perhaps it is because I've read pretty much everything Michel Houellebecq has written and I think he's head and shoulders above Szalay, writing on the same topics.\n\nThen again, I don't tend to like books in which the reader needs to fill in too many blanks. [A reviewer](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/nov/10/booker-winner-flesh-david-szalay-biggest-metaphysical-questions) wrote that the charm of Szalay's book lays in its minimalism (\"Szalay has always been interested in how much the writer can leave out\") and the fact that \"untold depths of emotion brimmed in the spaces between sentences\", but I do prefer books that tell me about these things, that's why I read, not to stare at a blank space and fill it with my own stuff.","created_utc":1762864291.0,"parent_id":"t1_no8rk9z","link_id":"t3_1otr99z","score":2,"is_submitter":false}
