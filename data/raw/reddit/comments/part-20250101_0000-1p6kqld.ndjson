I went and priced it out because I was curious.  If you starting roasting garlic and throwing in parm from Italy, you could push it up to $75 easily.

Even if they mix it up with other sides, even something more expensive per pound like brussels sprouts, they'd need to bring 31 pounds of brussels sprouts - that's about one and a half pounds of brussels sprouts per person. \n\nMeat is just more expensive per pound than anything else. When you offer to be the one to purchase and make the meat, you know that. \n\nAnd, tbh, what on earth is he making? Turkey is at most a dollar a pound right now. (79c-98c per pound at my Walmart). Let's just say he's getting some kind of fancy turkey that's $3 a pound. $300 would still be 100 pounds of turkey - 5 pounds per guest.

Teachers aren’t paid that well. \n\nLooking up salaries to make people feel bad is so disgusting to me. My sister tries to play a pity party all the time because her and her husband don’t have a house. For context, I’m nearly 40, and my sister is 5 years older. They’ve been renting the same duplex for over 10 years. They have 2 kids, never go on vacation (that’s another thing she complains about), no social life, etc. My brother in law works IT, makes a regular living, and my sister doesn’t work. She’s a stay at home mom but her 2 kids are in public school so I don’t see why she can’t work. \n\nMeanwhile, my wife and I just bought our second home, as our old one we decided was too small. She complained that they never owned a home. I even offered to sell her our old home for a HUGE discount, because I wouldn’t be using a realtor or anything. She said she couldn’t afford it. It’s a good small home at a fraction of the price for what it’s worth. She then brought up how much I make to our whole family (I’m in government, she found my salary). I make a regular living. My wife however also works. She makes more than me. Our son is in daycare, which costs nearly 3k per month (HCOL area). We go on vacation often. Have a good house now. \n\nIt’s not our fault she is bad with money, they never bought a house, they never go on trips, etc, those are all self inflicted. All she needs to do is work for a second salary and they could easily afford a house. But shaming my wife and I for living “the good life” as she calls it isn’t fair.

I know nobody wants to get down to the nitty gritty, but I think it's pretty normal to take that into consideration.\n\nOP's sister had \"Bring enough food for everyone\" as an option, but that's silly because if everybody does that, there's going to be way more food than necessary. OP could bring enough mashed potato so that everybody could have some, and that would be a reasonable request, and maybe the rule is every adult brings enough of whatever they're bringing for everybody, and that would be ok (a lot of leftovers, but still fine), but I think there's a very decent chance OP's sister does have a large family (but not 15 people large) and is trying to treat all families the same regardless of size so she doesn't have to actually put in any effort, since her son is cooking the meat.","created_utc":1764115293.0,"parent_id":"t1_nqsjs6o","link_id":"t3_1p6kqld","score":32,"is_submitter":false}
