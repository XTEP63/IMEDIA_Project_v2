Reckless to trade Luka, etc etc. if you're going to do that, you're accepting a high degree of risk. This is a logical outcome of said-risk.\n\nAlso \"to be fair\", Nico deserves 0 credit for Cooper Flagg, whatever he becomes. That had nothing to do with vision, that's just the Mavs literally hitting the lottery.\n\nImo, good riddance.
