But I decided to do was play to my strengths and also stop getting completely emotionally invested in the apps. The apps aren’t designed to help me out or give me a fighting chance, even if I was 6’6 and a model. It’s designed to retain me and in a sense, play to my insecurities.\n\nSo I definitely started to take care of myself. Exercised more, started a skincare routine, wore clothes that fit better. But I also decided to lean into my hobbies that I was really interested in. I also stopped thinking like “a man” so to speak and more like a “person”. The things my SO finds attractive I can understand and it’s usually related to something I find attractive, which is why we’re together. So women (or men) that see you out and engaged in your interests (cycling, chess, basketball, community theater), they’ll let you know they’re interested.\n\n> but the truth is that often times there's not as much one can do about their place in the \"hierarchy\" so to speak.\n\nWell there is, and its acceptance. I knew pretty early on that I wasn’t going to be dating Zendaya, and that’s fine. There’s plenty of women outside of Zendaya and maybe the traditionally thought “Zendaya/supermodel tier” of beauty that I find very attractive. There’s also a lot of internal things I find attractive about people. Once I really leaned into that I realized the hierarchy is a lot more amorphous than I originally assumed.","created_utc":1762812348.0,"parent_id":"t1_no658bw","link_id":"t3_1otjf0j","score":8,"is_submitter":false}
