Bigotry in all forms: sexism, racism, homophobia, colorism. Picking apart fashion choices and looks, accents, literally anything they can think of, it’s like everyone gets their rocks off just being a troll or asshole. Catcalling everywhere. The general message that if you get assaulted or robbed, which is pretty common, it was always the victims fault for being idiots.","created_utc":1762824531.0,"parent_id":"t1_no6gu1d","link_id":"t3_1otq90z","score":9,"is_submitter":false}

People who frequented the grocery stores, gym, and clubs I went to at the time. Most were university students who allegedly went to Paraguay for cheaper education, from what I remember. Others were younger businesspeople sent there by corporations from their home countries.","created_utc":1762816995.0,"parent_id":"t1_no6qkh7","link_id":"t3_1otq90z","score":3,"is_submitter":false}

Our relatively not so horrible PBI (GDP) per capita is largely dependent on extractive industries like mining and the fact that we have like 3 5ths of Colombia’s total population. Extreme poverty is all to common in Peru, and from what I’ve seen, Colombia is more descentralized and has a more diversified economy, so it seems unlikely.","created_utc":1762811527.0,"parent_id":"t1_no6fcu6","link_id":"t3_1otq90z","score":3,"is_submitter":false}
