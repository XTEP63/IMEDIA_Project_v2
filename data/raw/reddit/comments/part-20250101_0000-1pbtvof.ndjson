{"comment_id":"nrtvho2","post_id":"1pbtvof","author":"steelpeat","body":"Learned how to make a basic dal and rice recipe. Cook the red split lentils and add a temper to it. I ate it every day for about a year. I still love it. The trick to making it great is the temper. Heat up the oil so it's hot, put it the cumin seeds until they're bubbling and turning darker, then add chopped garlic and dried chili until brown. Then while everything is still ripping hot, pour over the cooked dal. It will sizzle. It basically infuses the dal with the infused oil and makes the dal undergo the Maillard reaction. \n\nA 2kg bag of split red lentils is enough for 9 days of food. It's $5 Canadian for that bag but is cheaper if you buy even bigger bags. A 4.4kg bag of rice is about $10 and will last about 4 weeks. A jug of oil is about $12 and lasts months. Salt, cumin seeds, garlic, and dried Chili's are also cheap.\n\nNutritionally it's a perfect meal. Potassium, protein, fibre are all there in better quantities than most meals. And the total cost is about $0.88 Canadian per day (3 meals totalling 2000 calories).\n\nEdit: changed values based on a spreadsheet I've made.

{"comment_id":"nru50d0","post_id":"1pbtvof","author":"SiggySiggy69","body":"When my wife and I were struggling early on trying to save for a home we did a few things and do keep doing it now: \n\n(1) We plan our meals out weekly, and often times cook 2 meals at dinner so the next day we just have to reheat and go. It also helps for lunches as leftovers are taken the next day. We found being intentional and having a plan cut down on frivolous spending by eating out. Cooking ahead made it easy when time is a factor. \n\n(2) We always keep rice, beans and some sort of canned veggie stocked up. Days when we didn’t have anything you just cook, mix, season and toss whatever meat we have into it (egg works in a pinch). At one point we basically ate rice, beans and canned corn/peas/carrots for 2 weeks straight. \n\n(3) Don’t sleep on rotisserie chickens. $5 at Costco or Sam’s Club. When we know moneys gonna be tight for a week I’ll buy 2, we will eat one normally with sides, then break down the extra and leftovers. They can be used on sandwiches to stretch it out, put into rice bowls, used as Ramen topping, and for taco meat if you need a change of pace. $10 in chicken makes for enough meat to gets us through a week, it’s simple to reheat and you can diversify easily. My favorite thing is to let it cool then roll it in a bag to easily remove bones, shred it then make garlic bread and top with bbq to make a chicken bbq sandwich. \n\nThe other things you can do is buy a whole chicken (I get a decent sized one for $6-7 at the grocery) season how you like then I’ll cut up potatoes, grab whatever veggies are on sale and drop it all into a crockpot and set on low for 8-10 hours. This can feed us about 3 dinners and 3 lunches. If you want to make it a soup you just add water or stock (stock for more flavor) then just shred the chicken and add it back in then mix. \n\nAt one point we were able to get our food bill down to $120 for two weeks. It took a lot of prep and we ate some of the same stuff over and over but we were able to save a ton of money. \n\nFood is necessary, but you can do necessary and healthy cost effectively by planning and being disciplined. We still follow much of this now, but we are lucky to be able to splurge here and there.","created_utc":1764651570.0,"parent_id":"t3_1pbtvof","link_id":"t3_1pbtvof","score":7,"is_submitter":false}

Ideally, use reusable rags instead\n- Many recipes suggest cutting off certain parts of the vegetable before using them as ingredients. Most of the time, it's because they don't taste as good.

It comes with the special stainless spatula and a wooden lid.   \n7. Watch some YouTube videos on technique. \n\nIt really is crazy filling. Even one egg, 1/2 to 3/4 cup of rice, and then a cup or a cup and a half of veggies yields a lot of food that really does taste amazing.

Can’t afford a therapist and struggling on some ends but definitely trying my best to coach through it. My boyfriend jokes that I’m a nester cause I’ll bring a small bag of food with me and stuff it next to me - I feel like a squirrel but it’s better to have small stuff on me than the daunting kitchen 😆 sorry for the ramble I hope this made sense lolol","created_utc":1764654402.0,"parent_id":"t1_nruark0","link_id":"t3_1pbtvof","score":7,"is_submitter":false}
