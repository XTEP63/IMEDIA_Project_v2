{"comment_id":"no6x1js","post_id":"1otlfzz","author":"Choice-of-SteinsGate","body":"Republicans have the gall to claim that Democrats are \"holding the country hostage\" while they are abusing their trifecta of power to not only prolong a shutdown and lock in their cuts to healthcare and food assistance, but to also avoid a vote on releasing Epstein related materials. Mike Johnson has repeatedly used this shutdown as an excuse to delay their release.\n\nJohnson is obviously toeing the line to prevent the discharge of what is very likely information that could implicate Trump in Epstein's heinous crimes.\n\nThat said, try as he might, he couldn't indefinitely postpone Grijalva's swearing in. In fact, Johnson's whole excuse blaming it on the shutdown is a bunch of BS because he swore in two Republicans during \"pro forma\" meetings earlier this year.\n\nPro forma translates to \"in form only,\" and they are basically very short meetings that a small number of lawmakers can call during shutdowns to keep Congress in session without actually doing any real legislative work.\n\nJohnson never had the legal authority to continuously impede Grijalva's swearing in.\n\nHowever, when she is sworn in and she votes on the discharge petition, Republicans can put up several roadblocks and delay a vote or even kill it. In a normal world, this would reflect poorly on Republicans.\n\nBut if they actually succeed at continuing to block the release of Epstein related material, Democrats have to abandon the \"strongly worded letter\" approach and seize the opportunity to relentlessly attack them for covering up this scandal and protecting pedophiles.","created_utc":1762816963.0,"parent_id":"t3_1otlfzz","link_id":"t3_1otlfzz","score":3,"is_submitter":false}

Many, people forgot about: Remember the DC Madam?  Heidi Fleiss?  The Panama Papers?  The Paradise Papers?\n\nThe fact of the matter is that while the Epstein Files are probably chock-full of names of people Epstein associated with and possibly even client lists, by and large the American people don't care.  Not beyond the ability to score a few political points and move on.\n\nMost people's responses will probably be something along the lines of \"Oh that's awful!  Those people are horrible and should be thrown out of office.\"  Then, come next November, they'll have either forgotten all about it or will say, \"That was ages ago; I've moved on\".  Which is easy to do when you're not the victims here, but I digress.\n\nI had hoped Johnson would be forced to release, but the more I think about it the more I realize that even if he did it wouldn't matter by the time January rolls around, much less the next midterms.","created_utc":1762828314.0,"parent_id":"t1_no7e8yr","link_id":"t3_1otlfzz","score":4,"is_submitter":false}
