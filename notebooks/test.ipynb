         "for context, I (18F) have moved into my first college dorm, and have a roommate (also 18F), who is an international student. \n\nwe like talked over the phone and stuff constantly during summer, but the day before college started with, my girlfriend broke up with me.\n\nthat was my first experience with a breakup and it was really unexpected, so i kinda spiraled into a depression and was really stressed out with dealing with that AND being in college for the first time.\n\non the phone, my roommate and i said we’d explore lots of places together and do all this stuff, but after the breakup, i honestly just shut down and it was not a great first irl impression. she said she understands but i feel really bad that i promised all these things and now we barely speak. i also have depression too (and possibly bpd) and have had to go up on anti-depressants because of the breakup, which is affecting my mood and making me numb in a sense. \n\nwe don’t really speak at all, and she’s made friends with other people in our hall, which is totally fine. but as i said before, she’s an international student, and lived in thailand prior to moving to america. so i assume she can only call her parents during night hours. \n\nbut the problem is, she’s always pretty loud when she talks to them and keeps the light on until like 12:00am talking to them, and i don’t wanna be a jerk and be like “no you can’t talk to your parents at night” because i go on my phone anyways but it’s still kind of annoying because there’s just no reason to be on the phone and have the light on THAT late at night like i understand until 11:00-11:30pm or something but as im typing this she literally turned off the light and said bye to her parents at 12:12am. \n\nAITH? i just feel bad because the breakup thing im dealing with has already strained our relationship so much and i feel like it’d be so rude to be like, not only am i going to not do anything i said id do with you, but you can only talk with your parents for this amount of time! \n\nbut at the same time, i feel like it’s just not “night etiquette” (idk how to describe it like i hope you guys get what im saying) to just be on the phone and have the light on for that long i feel like the night is a time to just unwind and relax and it’s really hard to do that when she’s like talking with her parents and having little arguments with them too.

         "Hello everyone,\n\n  \nThis is my first time posting here and I’m feeling quite lost.  \n\n\nI’m 35M and my girlfriend is 40F. We’ve been together for almost 4 years.  \nShe is honestly an amazing woman kind, funny, supportive, beautiful, sexy, fit… she really checks a lot of boxes for me.  \nShe also has two kids (8 and 12) who are really sweet and kind to me. On paper, we look like a happy, stable family.\n\nBut here’s the main issue: **she doesn’t want any more children**.  \nAnd me… I’m not even sure if *I* want kids. I don’t have a strong “yes,” but I also don’t have a strong “no.”\n\nWhat confuses me is that every time a friend tells me they’re expecting a baby, I feel this strange sadness  like a sense of missing out or maybe fear that I’ll never experience that part of life. I don’t know if this means I want kids, or if it’s more about social pressure and comparison.\n\nAt the same time, I often feel out of place in my “stepdad role.”  \nI care about her kids, but when I pick them up at school, go to football practice, or handle family logistics, I sometimes feel like I’m living someone else’s life. Like I’m the extra adult in a family that isn’t really mine.  \nIt’s a weird mix of attachment and disconnection.\n\nThere are other things too:  \n– My girlfriend is quite jealous sometimes, which drains me.  \n– We live far from my work, and the logistics of a blended family are heavy.  \n– I struggle with the idea that, if we break up one day, I’ll have no rights and will lose the kids emotionally anyway.  \n– Sometimes I even browse forums like “childfree and happy” or “people who had kids later in life” because I’m trying to understand what I actually want.\n\nToday things got really emotional and we almost broke up. I had a complete breakdown because I’m so unsure about my future, hers, and the kids’.\n\n**I love her, she’s a great partner, but I can’t tell if this life is truly aligned with who I am or if I’m just staying because I’m afraid of being alone and starting over.**\n\nI don’t know what to do.  \nHas anyone been in a similar situation?  \nHow do you make a decision when both staying and leaving feel painful?",

         "We’ve been together six months. She had a lot of male friends before we met due to her work and hobbies being more male than female, not an issue. But I didn’t realise the extent to which she hangs out with them 1-on-1.\n\nFor example, she just started a new job a couple of months ago. She hasn’t told any of her colleagues about us because I work in the same field and sometimes our companies work together, and she wants to remain professional. She made a new male friend, no biggy, everyone has friends at work. But they’ve been to see movies together, get food together, go on drives together. I brought it up and she said “We’re just friends because he’s nice to me. He has a long term girlfriend. If you don’t trust that I can hang out with friends then do you believe I actually like you? I have loads of male friends and always have, do you expect me to just drop them?”.\n\nI kind of get her point, but at the same time it just hurts my stomach every time she tells me what she’s been up to with one of her pals. I feel like an idiot who’s being strung along. She’s really sweet so I don’t think she’s doing it on purpose, I think she genuinely believes this is fine. From my point of view, I think it would be outrageous for me to be in a committed relationship and make one on one plans with new female friends and I would never do it. I’m really struggling. I even feel ridiculous that I feel ‘threatened’, it’s like a lose-lose. Is this reconcilable or a fundamentally different mindset?",

It could not be fixed. I did not renew my subscription to their service. \n\n  \nI have not set foot in a best buy since that day, nor have I been on the best buy website since 2023 when I purchased another laptop. \n\n  \nFour days ago I got the first substantial paycheck in a while. My hours were being cut, my shifts were being cancelled. Money was tight. My paycheck finally made it to 200$.\n\nThree days ago, best buy randomly decides that I want another year of this subscription. It charges me 194$ for a service I haven't paid for since 2022. It takes my entire paycheck, and since I paid my bills on friday, the day I got paid, it overdraws my account more than 100$. \n\n  \nI checked to make sure that none of my family members accidentally charged something to my card, made sure I didn't have any emails from best buy. Nothing. No little unauthorized charges on the card that meant someone was testing to see if I would notice, either. \n\n  \nI contested the charge and my bank let me know it could take anywhere from a week to 90 days to ever see that paycheck again.

I heard that VTI is more tax efficient, so I'm wondering if it's worth it to transfer (I heard Vanguard lets you do that) or if I should just keep it in VTSAX. Or should I just contribute to VTI moving forward? Or just continue with VTSAX for simplicity?",

         "How to route emails to own (non exchange server) if smtp auth is enforced",
         "Hi, \n\n  \nHopefully, I am not on the wrong subreddit. We use teams, and with it come email addresses and exchange in azure. \n\nHowever, our email remains hosted on our own non exchange server. When we setup a teams meeting, invites are sent on behalf of us directly by exchange365 for external recipients and to the internal exchange mailboxes our domain teams addresses which we do not use...\n\n  \nI found the connectors, and tried to configure one to reroute outgoing email through our own server. However this fails because : \n\n \\- SMTP Auth is enforced by our server, and exchange does have our passwords.\n\n  \nMy question is how is it possible to make a connector that will send teams invites our own server, despite our server enforcing smtp auth?. \n\nIs it possible to specify a different mail from for the connector? \n\nThe second issue I have is that with restrictive dmarc policy, exchange will not be able to dkim sign our emails. Routing all email via our own server would make this simpler, but also has the problem of the smtp auth for sending email from our addresses.\n\n  \nI could not find documentation of that kind of use case. Maybe there is one explaining all this I just did not find yet, but you can point to me :)\n\n  \nRegards,",

         "Wedding venue changing terms after grandmother (co-signer) passed away, refusing to honor written postponement agreement. What are our options?",
         "Location: Dallas, TX\n\nMy fiancée and I were supposed to get married in February 2026. The wedding contract was signed by both my fiancée and her grandmother. Her grandmother was also the one funding the wedding.\n\nIn September, my fiancée’s grandmother passed away unexpectedly. Since then, the probate process has been slow and complicated, and the funds for the wedding are currently tied up in probate. We still owe about $6,000 on the wedding, and the total cost is around $12k–14k. We informed the venue as soon as we were able to.\n\nBecause we suddenly lost the person paying for the wedding, we initially asked the venue about canceling. They did not respond to any emails for almost 25 days other than \"I will get back to you in a few days\". When they finally replied, they said that because the date was within 6 months, cancellation would require us to pay **90% of the full balance**, with no refund of anything already paid. They also told us we would have to pay that amount upfront even if we had wedding insurance, and “hope the insurance pays out.”\n\nWe cannot afford to pay $6,000 out of pocket and gamble on an insurance reimbursement.\n\nBecause of this, we decided we wanted to *proceed* with the wedding but postpone the date to allow the probate funds to come through. The venue agreed **in writing** to:\n\n* waive the $500 postponement fee\n* allow us to postpone until probate finalized\n* push out the payment schedule\n\nAfter that written agreement, communication stopped again. Today someone new (a district manager) emailed us and said they would **not** waive the $500 fee and that the amount “is still due per accounting/legal.”\n\nThis contradicts the written agreement we already received. We also don’t know if our original planner still works there. We keep getting bounced around with no consistency, and every time we reach out we get a different answer. Meanwhile, we are dealing with the loss of a close family member and trying to get through probate.\n\nWe want to fulfill the contract; we just need time for the estate funds to be released. At this point we feel like we’re being ignored and pressured into fees we were previously told were waived.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n1. Are written email agreements to waive fees/postpone dates legally enforceable if they came from the venue planner?\n2. Can the venue go back on a written modification after we relied on it?\n3. Does the death of a co-signer affect enforceability of the original contract or postponement terms?\n4. What steps can we take to compel the venue to honor the written postponement?\n5. Would this be suitable for a demand letter, small claims, or a state AG consumer complaint?\n\nAny guidance is appreciated. This is taking a huge mental toll on us.",
